	abstract = {This paper presents an optimized software implementation of a Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder for polar codes. Despite the strong data dependencies in SC decoding, a highly parallel software polar decoder is devised for x86 processor target. A high level of performance is achieved by exploiting the parallelism inherent in today's processor architectures (SIMD, multicore, etc.). Some optimizations that were originally thought for hardware implementation (memory reduction techniques and algorithmic simplifications) were also applied to enhance the throughput of the software implementation. Finally, some low level optimizations such as explicit assembly description or data packing are used to improve the throughput even more. The resulting decoder description is implemented on different x86 processor targets. An analysis of the decoder in terms of latency and throughput is proposed. The influence of several parameters on the throughput and the latency is investigated: the selected target, the code rate, the code length, the SIMD mode (SSE/AVX), the multithreading mode, etc. The energy per decoded bit is also estimated. The proposed software decoder compares favorably with state of the art software polar decoders. Extensive experimentations demonstrate that the proposed software polar decoder exceeds 1 Gb/s for code lengths N <= 217 on a single core and reaches multi-Gb/s throughputs when using four cores in parallel in AVX mode.},

	abstract = {Error detection and correction plays a vital role in modern information storage and communication systems. Polar codes are gathering a lot of attention as they are a class of capacity-achieving error-correcting codes with an explicit construction that can be decoded with low-complexity algorithms. However, their adoption is hindered by the lack of high-speed{\textemdash}high throughput and low latency{\textemdash}hardware and software decoders for codes of practical length and rate. This thesis presents various solutions to this problem. It introduces modifications to the state-of-the-art low-complexity decoding algorithm to better accommodate low-rate polar codes. It also proposes a code construction alteration process. Hardware implementation results show good latency reduction and throughput improvement with little to negligible coding loss for low-rate moderate-length polar codes. Then, it presents high-speed software polar decoders. It shows how adapting the decoding algorithm at various levels can lead to significant improvements in latency and throughput, yielding polar decoders that are suitable for high-performance software-defined radio applications on modern desktop processors and embedded-platform processors. These proposed decoders have an order of magnitude lower latency and memory footprint compared to state-of-the-art decoders, while maintaining comparable throughput. In addition, strategies and results for implementing polar decoders on graphical processing units are presented.Next, it demonstrates that polar decoders can achieve extremely high throughput values and retain moderate complexity. It presents a family of architectures for hardware polar decoders that employ unrolling. The resulting fully-unrolled architectures are capable of achieving a throughput that is two to three orders of magnitude greater than current state of the art while maintaining good energy efficiency. Moreover, the proposed architectures are flexible in a way that makes it possible to explore the trade-off between area, throughput and energy efficiency. Lastly, while unrolled decoders provide the greatest decoding speed, they are built for a specific, fixed, code i.e. the code length or rate cannot be modified at execution time. Most modern wireless communication applications largely benefit from the support of multiple code lengths and rates. This thesis shows how an unrolled decoder can be transformed into a multi-mode decoder supporting many codes of various lengths and rates. Implementation results show a peak information throughput that is an order of magnitude greater than the state of the art, while showing the best area and energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Scheduling algorithm design is a critical and challenging issue in multiuser wireless networks with dynamic flows. The well-known Queue-length-based MaxWeight (QMW) scheduling algorithm can achieve throughput-optimality if there only exist persistent flows that are long-lived with infinite traffic arrival. In this paper, we propose a head-of-line access delay (HAD)-based scheduling algorithm and show that it is throughput-optimal when the flows are dynamic, i.e., they are short-lived with finite data to transmit. HAD is an online algorithm and does not require prior knowledge of the statistics of the arrival traffic and channel information. We also develop the Markov analytic model to study system performance and reveal important properties of the proposed HAD scheduling algorithm. To reduce the complexity of the analysis, we further study two approximation methods corresponding to different arrival traffic intensity. Performance evaluation shows that the HAD scheduling algorithm can outperform the classic QMW and stabilize the system at the presence of flow-level dynamics. Compared to the other existing algorithms, HAD is practical to implement with a better delay performance.},

The toolbox is written in C++ and can be used either as a simulator to quickly evaluate algorithms characteristics, or as a library in Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems or for other specific needs. Most of the decoding algorithm implementations aim at low latency and high throughput, targeting multiple Gb/s on modern CPUs. This is crucial in both simulation and SDR use cases: Monte Carlo simulations require high performance implementation as they commonly target the estimation of approximately 1012 bits. On the other hand, the implementations in real systems have to be very efficient to be competitive against dedicated hardware ones. Finally, AFF3CT emphasizes the reproducibility of state-of-the-art results by providing public references and open, modular source code.},

We first address the problem of choosing the cyclic delays and propose a new robust design rule which enables to pick up the full spatial and frequency diversity which is inherent in a frequency-selective MIMO channel. Our choice of cyclic delays has consequences for the interleaving and multiple access scheme since the spatial diversity appears to be transformed into frequency diversity between neighbouring subcarriers. Therefore, a system with a conventional block frequency interleaver will fail to exploit the spatial diversity. We propose an interleaving and multiple access strategy which guarantees that all users obtain the maximum possible diversity advantage using FEC codes with a limited constraint length. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison to transmit diversity from orthogonal designs. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Two capacity-achieving channel coding schemes of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and polar codes have been adopted for 5G where the former is for user data and the latter is for control information. As a coding scheme for data, 5G LDPC codes are designed to support high throughput, a variable code rate and length and hybrid automatic repeat request in addition to good error correcting capability. 5G polar codes, as a coding scheme for control, are designed to perform well with short block length while addressing a latency issue of successive cancellation decoding.},

Polar coding was originally designed to be a low-complexity recursive channel combining and splitting operation of this type, to be used as the inner code in a concatenated scheme with outer convolutional coding and sequential decoding. However, the polar inner code turned out to be so effective that no outer code was actually needed to achieve the original aim of boosting the cutoff rate to channel capacity.

The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels WN(i)1 les i les N such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels WN(i) are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) {\textgreater} 0 and any target rate R{\textless} I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes Cfrn;nges1 such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate.

	abstract = {The fifth-generation (5G) network is presented as one of the main options for Industry 4.0 connectivity. Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) is the 5G service category used by critical mechanisms, with a millisecond end-to-end delay and reduced probability of failure. 5G defines new numerologies, together with mini-slots for a faster scheduling. The main challenge of this is to select the appropriate numerology according to radio conditions. This fact is very important in industrial scenarios, where the fundamental problems are interference and multipath propagation, due to the presence of concrete walls and large metallic machinery and structures. Therefore, this paper is focused on analyzing the impact of the numerology selection on the delay experienced at radio link level for a remote-control service. The study, which has been carried out in a simulated cellular factory environment, has been performed for different packet sizes and channel conditions, focusing on outliers. Evaluation results show that not always a higher numerology, with a shorter slot duration, is appropriate for this type of service, particularly under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions.},

In Cloud-RAN, functions can be flexibly split between central and distributed units, which enables the use of different types of transport network. Ethernet-based fronthaul can be an attractive solution for Cloud-RAN. On the one hand, the deployment of Ethernetbased fronthaul enables Cloud-RAN to provide more diverse, flexible and cost-efficient solutions. On the other hand, Ethernet-based fronthaul requires packetized communication, which imposes challenges to delivering stringent latency requirements between RAN functionalities. In this paper, we set up a hardware experiment based on Cloud-RAN with a low layer split, particularly between medium access control and the physical layer. The aim is to demonstrate how multi-path and channel coding over the fronthaul can improve fronthaul reliability while ensuring that: (i) latency results meet the standard requirements; and (ii) the overall system operates properly. Our results show that the proposed solution can improve fronthaul reliability while latency remains below a strict latency bound required by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project for this functional split.},

	abstract = {Digital communications devices designed with application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology suffer from one very significant limitation{\textemdash}the integrated circuits are not programmable. Therefore, deploying a new algorithm or an updated standard requires new hardware. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) solve this problem by introducing what is essentially reconfigurable hardware. Thus, digital communications devices designed on FPGAs are capable of accommodating multiple communications protocols without the need to deploy new hardware, and can support new protocols in a matter of seconds. In
addition, FPGAs provide a means to update systems that are physical difficult to access. For these reasons, FPGAs provide us with an ideal platform for implementing adaptive communications algorithms.
This thesis focuses on using FPGAs to implement an adaptive digital communications system. Using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) as a base, this thesis aims to create a highly-adaptive, plug and play software-defined radio (SDR) that fits CubeSat form-factor satellites. Such a radio platform would enable CubeSat engineers to develop new satellites faster and with lower costs. This thesis presents a new system, the CubeSat SDR, that adapts the USRP platform to better suit the space and power limitations of a CubeSat.},

	abstract = {The aim of this thesis is defining and developing the concept of an efficient management of radio and computing resources in an SDR cloud. The SDR cloud breaks with today's cellular architecture. A set of distributed antennas are connected by optical fibre to data processing centres. The radio and computing infrastructure can be shared between different operators (virtualization), reducing costs and risks, while increasing the capacity and creating new business models and opportunities. The data centre centralizes the management of all system resources: antennas, spectrum, computing, routing, etc. Specially relevant is the computing resource management (CRM), whose objective is dynamically providing sufficient computing resources for a real-time execution of signal processing algorithms. Current CRM techniques are not designed for wireless applications. We demonstrate that this imposes a limit on the wireless traffic a CRM entity is capable to support. Based on this, a distributed management is proposed, where multiple CRM entities manage a cluster of processors, whose optimal size is derived from the traffic density. Radio resource management techniques (RRM) also need to be adapted to the characteristics of the new SDR cloud architecture. We introduce a linear cost model to measure the cost associated to the infrastructure resources consumed according to the pay-per-use model. Based on this model, we formulate the efficiency maximization power allocation problem (EMPA). The operational costs per transmitted bit achieved by EMPA are 6 times lower than with traditional power allocation methods. Analytical solutions are obtained for the single channel case, with and without channel state information at the transmitter. It is shown that the optimal transmission rate is an increasing function of the product of the channel gain with the operational costs divided by the power costs. The EMPA solution for multiple channels has the form of water-filling, present in many power allocation problems. In order to be able to obtain insights about how the optimal solution behaves as a function of the problem parameters, a novel technique based on ordered statistics has been developed. This technique allows solving general water-filling problems based on the channel statistics rather than their realization. This approach has allowed designing a low complexity EMPA algorithm (2 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art algorithms). Using the ordered statistics technique, we have shown that the optimal transmission rate behaviour with respect to the average channel gains and cost parameters is equivalent to the single channel case and that the efficiency increases with the number of available channels. The results can be applied to design more efficient SDR clouds. As an example, we have derived the optimal ratio of number of antennas per user that maximizes the efficiency. As new users enter and leave the network, this ratio should be kept constant, enabling and disabling antennas dynamically. This approach exploits the dynamism and elasticity provided by the SDR cloud. In summary, this dissertation aims at influencing towards a change in the communications system management model (typically RRM), considering the introduction of the new infrastructure model (SDR cloud), new business models (based on Cloud Computing) and a more conciliatory view of an efficient resource management, not only focused on the optimization of the spectrum usage.},

	abstract = {Flexibility is one mandatory aspect of channel coding in modern wireless communication systems. Among other things, the channel decoder has to support several code lengths and code rates. This need for flexibility applies to polar codes that are considered for control channels in the future 5G standard. This paper presents a new generic and flexible implementation of a software Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder. A large set of parameters can be fine-tuned dynamically without re-compiling the software source code: the code length, the code rate, the frozen bits set, the puncturing patterns, the cyclic redundancy check, the list size, the type of decoding algorithm, the tree-pruning strategy and the data quantization. This generic and flexible SCL decoder enables to explore tradeoffs between throughput, latency and decoding performance. Several optimizations are proposed to achieve a competitive decoding speed despite the constraints induced by the genericity and the flexibility. The resulting polar list decoder is about 4 times faster than previous generic software decoders and only 2 times slower than previous non-flexible unrolled decoders. Thanks to the flexibility of the decoder, the fully adaptive SCL algorithm can be easily implemented and achieves higher throughput than any other similar decoder in the literature, up to 425 Mb/s on a single processor core for N = 2048 and K = 1723 at 4.5 dB.},

SDR clouds describe distributed antennas that connect to a data center for digital signal processing. The data center employs cloud computing technology, providing a virtualized computing resource pool. The service area of a single SDR cloud may be a metropolitan area with a high user density. Hence, the data center will execute thousands of SDR applications in parallel, providing wireless communications services to several radio cells. Whenever a user initiates or terminates a wireless communications session, computing resources need to be allocated or deallocated in real time. We therefore propose a hierarchical resource management. This paper justifies such an approach and analyzes different resource management strategies.

However, current cellular architectures have several disadvantages: they are not compatible with today{\textquoteright}s users{\textquoteright} data-rate requests and do not leverage recent wireless enhancement techniques to achieve those data rates. Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a new paradigm for broadband wireless access that provides a higher degree of cooperation and communication among Base Stations (BSs), in which all the BS computational resources are pooled in a central location, e.g., a set of physical servers in a datacenter. C-RAN represents a clean-slate design and allows for dynamic reconfiguration of computing and spectrum resources.
In this article, first explanations are provided on how this transformative paradigm can help overcome current cellular network limitations; then, its potential advantages to enable and support cooperative techniques like macro-diversity and collaborative spatial multiplexing are discussed. In addition,  innovative C-RAN-based techniques to decrease the bandwidth-limiting Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) problem are proposed. Last, but not least, novel provisioning and allocation methods of Virtual Base Stations (VBSs) in the Base Band Unit (BBU) are proposed, and their pros and cons thoroughly discussed.},

Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way.Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad codeHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good codeHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classesHow to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logicHow to unit test and practice test-driven developmentWhat smells and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

	url = {http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953107578},
	abstract = {Error-correcting codes enable reliable and efficient data communication and storage and have become an indispensable part of information processing systems. Polar codes are the latest discovery in the quest for more powerful error correction. They are the first codes with an explicit construction to provably achieve the symmetric capacity of memoryless channels. Moreover, this
performance is realizable using the low complexity successive-cancellation decoding algorithm.
Despite their attractive theoretical properties, polar codes suffer from two major issues hindering practical implementations: a slow decoding algorithm and mediocre error-correction performance at moderate code lengths. Solutions to these problems in the literature have been mutually exclusive. Decoding speed can be increased, but at the cost of degrading error-correction capability. On the other hand, the error-correction performance can be greatly improved using a list
decoding algorithm, which incurs a large cost in both decoding speed and memory requirements. This incompatibility in solutions must be resolved before polar codes become practical.
This thesis presents novel, compatible solutions to these problems. It introduces a new decoding algorithm that has the same error-correction performance as successive cancellation, but offers significantly lower latency and higher throughput. A corresponding decoder implementation is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art in the literature.
Next, the speed of successive-cancellation list decoders for polar codes is improved without degrading error-correction performance. The resulting software decoders implementing the proposed algorithm offer throughput and error-correction performance exceeding the best in the literature and meeting the requirements for the 802.11n WiFi standard.
This work also brings to light another beneficial property of polar codes that had not been studied before. It presents encoders and decoders that can operate on polar codes of any length and rate, while maintaining low implementation complexity and fast operating speed. Such implementations are important in systems that must adapt to varying channel conditions.
Finally, two methods are introduced that improve error-correction performance without incurring the memory overhead of list decoding. The first targets systems where re-transmission is impossible or highly undesirable. The second improves the performance of software decoders using polar codes with rates very close to the channel capacity.},

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, also referred to as Industrie 4.0, has triggered a number of research projects to improve communication systems for industrial environments. Wireless technologies for mission-critical machine-To-machine communication are expected to enable very efficient and highly flexible production processes. It is especially challenging for wireless interfaces to fulfill the required end-To-end latency and the reliability constraints of the automation industry. In order to design novel PHY and MAC schemes for ultra low delay, ultra reliable and deterministic transmission of data, e.g., through optimized pulse shaping, we study the indoor radio propagation in a representative factory automation cell where industrial robots are to be controlled. We performed channel measurements using a broadband channel sounder at 5.85 GHz carrier frequency. During the measurements, the robots were in motion and executed a typical pick-And-place process. From the recorded data we evaluate the channel characteristics and calculate relevant delay statistics. We distinguish two measurement series that differ in the scattering environment and present the derived parameters. Finally, we discuss the impact of our results on the design of new 5G waveforms for industrial radio systems.},

Nevertheless, considering its practical usage, the complexity issue has to be addressed. In this paper, we present a low complexity algorithm for the GFDM implementation which, under certain conditions, yields less computational complexity.

That is, the polar codes are not re-designed based on the modulation used. Instead, we propose bit-permuted coded modulation (BPCM): a technique for using the multilevel coding (MLC) approach for an arbitrary polar code. The BPCM technique exploits a natural connection between MLC and polar codes. It involves applying bit permutations prior to mapping the polar code to a higher order modulation. The bit permutations are designed, via density evolution, to match the rates provided by various bit levels of the higher order modulation to that of the polar code. We demonstrate performance of the BPCM technique using link simulations and density evolution for the AWGN channel. We compare the BPCM technique with the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) technique. When using polar codes designed for BPSK modulation, we show gains for BPCM over BICM with random interleaver of up to 0.2 dB, 0.7 dB and 1.4 dB for 4-ASK, 8-ASK, and 16-ASK respectively.},

With the flexibility of pulse shaping techniques and a tail-biting cyclic prefix, it has very low out of band leakage. This makes this potential 5G waveform suitable for cognitive radio opportunistic access with lower interference to the adjacent legacy/primary users. Because of the per-subcarrier pulse shaping technique, the cyclostationary autocorrelation properties of GFDM produces extra correlation peaks at particular cyclic frequencies. Cyclostationary detection based on these side peaks improve the spectrum sensing of GFDM over traditional OFDM. The GFDM receiver with ICI cancellation unit mitigates the ICI for any values of the roll-off factor, and hence, increasing the roll-off factor does not impact the BER performance of the GFDM system. This paper highlights the innovative cyclostationary properties of GFDM and studies the effect of pulse shaping roll-off factors on detection performance.},

To improve its error-correction performance, a list-based version called successive-cancellation list (SCL) has been proposed in the past, that however substantially increases the number of time-steps in the decoding process. The simplified SCL (SSCL) decoding algorithm exploits constituent codes within the polar code structure to greatly reduce the required number of time-steps without introducing any error-correction performance loss. In this paper, we propose a faster decoding approach to decode one of these constituent codes, the Rate-1 node. We use this Rate-1 node decoder to develop Fast-SSCL. We demonstrate that only a list-size-bound number of bits needs to be estimated in Rate-1 nodes and Fast-SSCL exactly matches the error-correction performance of SCL and SSCL. This technique can potentially greatly reduce the total number of time-steps needed for polar codes decoding: analysis on a set of case studies show that Fast-SSCL has a number of time-steps requirement that is up to 66.6\% lower than SSCL and 88.1\% lower than SCL.},

Discrete quantization is required to obtain this fixed alphabet size; a greedy algorithm which uses the mutual information between the code bit and message is presented. It is argued that using this message-passing decoding framework is more efficient for approaching channel capacity than simply quantizing the belief-propagation algorithm. This method is evaluated using regular LDPC codes on the binary symmetric channel. Using a maximum alphabet size of 16 (4 bits), noise thresholds close to those of belief propagation are obtained.},

Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no compiler has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly efficiently, VOLK approaches the problem differently. For each architecture or platform that a developer wishes to vectorize for, a new proto-kernel is added to VOLK. At runtime, VOLK will select the correct proto-kernel. In this way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for performing the operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This allows us to write portable SIMD code that is optimized for a variety of platforms.},

	abstract = {We present a framework to analyse the latency budget in wireless systems with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). Our focus is on teleoperation and telerobotics, as use cases that are representative of mission-critical uplink-intensive IoT systems with requirements on low latency and high reliability. The study is motivated by a general question: What is the optimal compression strategy in reliability and latency constrained systems? We address this question by studying the latency of an uplink connection from a multi-sensor IoT device to the base station. This is a critical link tasked with a timely and reliable transfer of potentially significant amount of data from the multitude of sensors. We introduce a comprehensive model for the latency budget, incorporating data compression and data transmission. The uplink latency is a random variable whose distribution depends on the computational capabilities of the device and on the properties of the wireless link. We formulate two optimization problems corresponding to two transmission strategies: (1) Outage-constrained, and (2) Latency-constrained. We derive the optimal system parameters under a reliability criterion. We show that the obtained results are superior compared to the ones based on the optimization of the expected latency.},

After a brief overview of the state of the art in LPWANs and the basics of DSSS systems, the novel modulation scheme SpaRSe (Spatial Modulation for Long Range Sensor Networks) is introduced, which combines the advantages of multi antenna technologies with simple modulation and low hardware complexity. Simulations show the considerable gains that can be achieved by SPaRSe in comparison to current standardized technologies. To underline the potential of the scheme, an implementation on a Software Defined Radio as well as results from a channel measurement campaign in an urban environment at 2.4 GHz are presented. The evaluation of the interference situation and the propagation characteristics of the wireless channel yield important insights, e.g., into the expected range of such a communication system. Furthermore, it shows that the assumptions regarding the simulations were well justified and that SpaRSe is very robust and clearly outperforms the current state of the art, even under realistic and suboptimal conditions.},

In C-RAN research, a variety of different functional splits is presented by different names and focusing on different directions. The functional split determines how many base station functions to leave locally, close to the user, with the benefit of relaxing fronthaul network bitrate and delay requirements, and how many functions to centralize with the possibility of achieving greater processing benefits. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive overview systematizing the different work directions for both research and industry, while providing a detailed description of each functional split option and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages. This paper gives an overview of where the most effort has been directed in terms of functional splits, and where there is room for further studies. The standardization currently taking place is also considered and mapped into the research directions. It is investigated how the fronthaul network will be affected by the choice of functional split, both in terms of bitrates and latency, and as the different functional splits provide different advantages and disadvantages, the option of flexible functional splits is also looked into.},

	abstract = {In this report, we provide a comparative study of state-of-the-art in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques with orthonormal analysis and synthesis basis. Two main categories, OFDM/QAM which adopts base-band Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and rectangular pulse shape, and OFDM/OQAM which uses baseband offset QAM and various pulse shapes, are intensively reviewed. OFDM/QAM can provide high data rate communication and effectively remove intersymbol interference (ISI) by employing guard interval, which costs a loss of spectral efficiency and increases power consumption. Meanwhile it remains very sensitive to frequency offset which causes inter-carrier interference (ICI). In order to achieve better spectral efficiency and reducing combined ISI/ICI, OFDM/OQAM using well designed pulses with proper Time Frequency Localization (TFL) is of great interest. Various prototype functions, such as rectangular, half cosine, Isotropic Orthogonal Transfer Algorithm (IOTA) function and Extended Gaussian Functions (EGF) are discussed and simulation results are provided to illustrate the TFL properties by the ambiguity function and the interference function.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) propagation measurements were conducted at three facilities representing a cross- section of different classes of industrial environments. Selected sites included a multi-acre transmission assembly factory typical of the automotive industry; a small-sized machine shop primarily engaged in met- alworking located on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg; and a steam generation plant located on the NIST campus in Boulder. A spread spectrum correlation sounder was used to take the measurements at a con- tinuum of points throughout the facility by fixing the transmitter and moving the receiver at a constant rate throughout each facility. We analyzed the data collected from the RF propagation measurements of each site. Analysis is based on channel impulse response (CIR) measurements collected during the measurement using equipment developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The results of our analy- sis include a tabulated summary and detailed exploration of various industry accepted channel metrics such as path loss, delay spread, and K factor. Our interpretation of the measurements contributes to an improved understanding of radio frequency propagation in factories and an additional perspective on deploying wire- less communication devices within factories. The raw measurement data and analysis software are made freely available for public download.},

	abstract = {Next generation (NextG) cellular networks will be natively cloud-based and built on programmable, virtualized, and disaggregated architectures. The separation of control functions from the hardware fabric and the introduction of standardized control interfaces will enable the definition of custom closed-control loops, which will ultimately enable embedded intelligence and real-time analytics, thus effectively realizing the vision of autonomous and self-optimizing networks. This article explores the disaggregated network architecture proposed by the O-RAN Alliance as a key enabler of NextG networks. Within this architectural context, we discuss the potential, the challenges, and the limitations of data-driven optimization approaches to network control over different timescales. We also present the first large-scale integration of O-RAN-compliant software components with an open source full-stack softwarized cellular network. Experiments conducted on Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator, demonstrate closed-loop integration of real-time analytics and control through deep reinforcement learning agents. We also show the feasibility of radio access network (RAN) control through xApps running on the near-real-time RAN intelligent controller to optimize the scheduling policies of coexisting network slices, leveraging the O-RAN open interfaces to collect data at the edge of the network.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of parallel concatenated (turbo) codes, iterative decoding has become a vital field of research in digital communications. Applications of the " turbo princi-ple " to many detection and decoding problems have been found. While most studies have focused on designing code concate-nations with respect to maximum likelihood decoding perfor-mance, the convergence properties of iterative decoding schemes have gained a considerable amount of interest just recently. In this paper we use the extrinsic information transfer chart (EXIT chart) to illuminate the convergence properties of bit{\textendash} interleaved coded modulation, equalization, and serially con-catenated binary codes. The EXIT chart leads to new design ideas like inner and outer doping, facilitating the construction of code concatenations with iterative decoders operating close to the capacity limit.},

We analyze the performance of FA-CSA in terms of packet loss rate and delay. In particular, we derive the (approximate) density evolution that characterizes the asymptotic performance of FA-CSA when the frame length goes to infinity. We show that, if the receiver can monitor the system before anyone starts transmitting, a boundary effect similar to that of spatially coupled codes occurs, which greatly improves the iterative decoding threshold. Furthermore, we derive tight approximations of the error floor (EF) for the finite frame length regime, based on the probability of occurrence of the most frequent stopping sets. We show that, in general, FA-CSA provides better performance in both the EF and waterfall regions as compared to FS-CSA. Moreover, FA-CSA exhibits better delay properties than FS-CSA.},

	abstract = {Polar codes have gained significant amount of attention during the past few years and have been selected as a coding scheme for the next generation of mobile broadband standard. Among decoding schemes, successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding provides a reasonable tradeoff between the error-correction performance and hardware implementation complexity when used to decode polar codes, at the cost of limited throughput. The simplified SCL (SSCL) and its extension SSCL-SPC increase the speed of decoding by removing redundant calculations when encountering particular information and frozen bit patterns (rate one and single parity check codes), while keeping the error-correction performance unaltered. In this paper, we improve SSCL and SSCL-SPC by proving that the list size imposes a specific number of path splitting required to decode rate one and single parity check codes. Thus, the number of splitting can be limited while guaranteeing exactly the same error-correction performance as if the paths were forked at each bit estimation. We call the new decoding algorithms Fast-SSCL and Fast-SSCL-SPC. Moreover, we show that the number of path forks in a practical application can be tuned to achieve desirable speed, while keeping the error-correction performance almost unchanged. Hardware architectures implementing both algorithms are then described and implemented: It is shown that our design can achieve \${\textbackslash}mathbf 1.86\$ Gb/s throughput, higher than the best state-of-the-art decoders.},

In this work, we first present a novel sequence repetition node corresponding to a particular class of bit sequences. Most existing special node types are special cases of the proposed sequence repetition node. Then, a fast parallel decoder is proposed for this class of node. To further speed up the decoding process of general nodes outside this class, a threshold-based hard-decision-aided scheme is introduced. The threshold value that guarantees a given error-correction performance in the proposed scheme is derived theoretically. Analysis and hardware implementation results on a polar code of length 1024 with code rates 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 show that our proposed algorithm reduces the required clock cycles by up to 8\%, and leads to a 10\% improvement in the maximum operating frequency compared to state-of-the-art decoders without tangibly altering the error-correction performance. In addition, using the proposed threshold-based hard-decision-aided scheme, the decoding latency can be further reduced by 57\% at Eb/N0 = 5.0 dB.},

Compared with other popular FEC codes, polar codes decoded by list successive cancellation decoding (LSCD) with a large list size have better error correction performance. However, due to the serial decoding nature of LSCD and the high complexity of list management, the decoding latency is high, which limits the usage of polar codes in practical applications that require low latency and high throughput. In this paper, we study the high-throughput implementation of LSCD with a large list size. Specifically, at the algorithmic level, to achieve a low-decoding latency with moderate hardware complexity, two decoding schemes, a multibit double thresholding scheme and a partial G-node look-ahead scheme, are proposed. Then, a high-throughput VLSI architecture implementing the proposed algorithms is developed with optimizations on different computation modules. From the implementation results on United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) 90 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the proposed architecture achieves decoding throughputs of 1.103 Gb/s, 977 Mb/s, and 827 Mb/s when the list sizes are 8, 16, and 32, respectively.},

This paper presents, in a tutorial form, the information theoretic framework underlying such ldquoadaptive modulationrdquo techniques. First, we review fading channel models, channel state information assumptions, and related capacity results. Then, we treat the case of input power constraint, where the optimal input distribution is Gaussian. Finally, we address the case of discrete modulations. In order to treat the latter, we make use of the recently developed method of ldquomercury-waterfillingrdquo, based on the relationship between mutual information and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation of the channel input from the channel output. While the traditional design of adaptive modulation schemes based on uncoded bit-error rate (BER) involves the optimization over a discrete set of signal constellations, when powerful (i.e., capacity approaching) coding schemes are used the corresponding adaptive coded modulation design becomes surprisingly simple. The regime of very powerful coding is justified by the use of modern coding schemes, such as turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes, able to perform close to channel capacity at very small BER.},

In an ideal information-theoretic model, BICM schemes are modeled as a set of multiple binary-input channels that experience different reliabilities. This model is referred to as multichannel. The conventional scheme for encoding information over multi-channels is to encode separately across the individual constituent channels, which requires multiple encoders and decoders. As opposed to the conventional scheme, we take advantage of the recursive structure of polar codes to construct a unified compound polar code. The proposed scheme has a single encoder and decoder and can be used over multi-channels, in particular over channels with BICM. We prove that the scheme achieves the multi-channel capacity with the same error decay rate as in Ar\&\#x0131;kan's polar codes. Furthermore, due to more levels of channel polarization, we obtain a better finite block length performance compared with the separated polarization scheme. This is confirmed through various simulations over the binary erasure channel and with transmissions over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fast fading channels with BICM and different modulation orders.},

Most known signal processing techniques -including gradient methods, Kalman filtering, and particle methods -can be used as components of such algorithms.

	abstract = {While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN) violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual, cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score. Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.},

In the proposed list decoder, up to \$L\$ decoding paths are considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Then, a single codeword is selected from the list as output. If the most likely codeword is selected, simulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of \$L\$. Alternatively, if a "genie" is allowed to pick the codeword from the list, the results are comparable to the current state of the art LDPC codes. Luckily, implementing such a helpful genie is easy. Our list decoder doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step, and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the \$L\$ "best" paths. \%In order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion that can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, a straightforward implementation still requires \${\textbackslash}backslashOmega(L {\textbackslash}backslashcdot n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ time, which is in stark contrast with the \$O(n {\textbackslash}backslashlog n)\$ complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We utilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem. Specifically, we devise an efficient, numerically stable, implementation taking only \$O(L {\textbackslash}backslashcdot n {\textbackslash}backslashlog n)\$ time and \$O(L {\textbackslash}backslashcdot n)\$ space.},

Of the many methods to improve the error-correction performance of polar codes, list decoding yields the best results, especially when the polar code is concatenated with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). List decoding involves exploring several decoding paths with SC decoding, and therefore tends to be slower than SC decoding itself, by an order of magnitude in practical implementations. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on unrolling the decoding tree of the code that improves the speed of list decoding by an order of magnitude when implemented in software. Furthermore, we show that for software-defined radio applications, our proposed algorithm is faster than the fastest software implementations of LDPC decoders in the literature while offering comparable error-correction performance at similar or shorter code lengths.},

Cellular systems of the next generation will face more diverse application requirements: the demand for higher data rates exceeds 4G capabilities; battery-driven communication sensors need ultra-low power consumption; and control applications require very short response times. We envision a unified physical layer waveform, referred to as generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM), to address these requirements. In this paper, we analyze the main characteristics of the proposed waveform and highlight relevant features. After introducing the principles of GFDM, this paper contributes to the following areas: 1) the means for engineering the waveform's spectral properties; 2) analytical analysis of symbol error performance over different channel models; 3) concepts for MIMO-GFDM to achieve diversity; 4) preamble-based synchronization that preserves the excellent spectral properties of the waveform; 5) bit error rate performance for channel coded GFDM transmission using iterative receivers; 6) relevant application scenarios and suitable GFDM parameterizations; and 7) GFDM proof-of-concept and implementation aspects of the prototype using hardware platforms available today.

An algorithm, which finds an optimal quantizer, in the sense of maximizing mutual information between the channel input and quantizer output is given. This result holds for arbitrary channels, in contrast to previous results for restricted channels or a restricted number of quantizer outputs. In the worst case, the algorithm complexity is cubic M3 in the number of channel outputs M. Optimality is proved using the theorem of Burshtein, Della Pietra, Kanevsky, and N{\'a}das for mappings, which minimize average impurity for classification and regression trees.},

The DP method has complexity \$O(q (N-M){\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},M)\$ , where \$N\$ and \$M\$ are the alphabet sizes of the DMC output and quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality, two techniques are applied to reduce the DP method{\textquoteright}s complexity. One technique makes use of the Shor-Moran-Aggarwal-Wilber-Klawe (SMAWK) algorithm and achieves complexity \$O(q (N-M) M)\$ . The other technique is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity \$O(q (N{\textasciicircum}2 - M{\textasciicircum}2))\$ . We further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal among all quantizers and the two techniques are applicable. This generalizes the results in the literature for binary-input DMC. Next, we show that the cost function of \${\textbackslash}alpha \$ -mutual information ( \${\textbackslash}alpha \$ -MI)-maximizing quantizer belongs to the category of \$C\$ . We further prove that under a weaker condition than the sufficient condition we derived, the aforementioned two techniques are applicable to the design of \${\textbackslash}alpha \$ -MI-maximizing quantizer. Finally, we illustrate the particular application of our design method to practical pulse-amplitude modulation systems.},

It generalizes the concept of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), featuring multiple circularly pulse-shaped subsymbols per subcarrier. This paper presents an algorithm for GFDM synchronization and investigates the use of a preamble that consists of two identical parts combined with a windowing process in order to satisfy low out of band radiation requirements. The performance of time and frequency estimation, with and without windowing, is evaluated in terms of the statistical properties of residual offsets and the impact on symbol error rate over frequency-selective channels. A flexible metric that quantifies the penalty of misalignments is derived. The results show that this approach performs practically as state-of-the-art OFDM schemes known in the literature, while it additionally can reduce the sidelobes of the spectrum emission.},

	abstract = {Unix is not so much an operating system as an oral history.
-- Neal Stephenson

There is a vast difference between knowledge and expertise. Knowledge lets you deduce the right thing to do; expertise makes the right thing a reflex, hardly requiring conscious thought at all.

This book has a lot of knowledge in it, but it is mainly about expertise. It is going to try to teach you the things about Unix development that Unix experts know, but aren't aware that they know. It is therefore less about technicalia and more about shared culture than most Unix books {\textemdash} both explicit and implicit culture, both conscious and unconscious traditions. It is not a {\textquoteleft}how-to{\textquoteright} book, it is a {\textquoteleft}why-to{\textquoteright} book.

The why-to has great practical importance, because far too much software is poorly designed. Much of it suffers from bloat, is exceedingly hard to maintain, and is too difficult to port to new platforms or extend in ways the original programmers didn't anticipate. These problems are symptoms of bad design. We hope that readers of this book will learn something of what Unix has to teach about good design.

This book is divided into four parts: Context, Design, Tools, and Community. The first part (Context) is philosophy and history, to help provide foundation and motivation for what follows. The second part (Design) unfolds the principles of the Unix philosophy into more specific advice about design and implementation. The third part (Tools) focuses on the software Unix provides for helping you solve problems. The fourth part (Community) is about the human-to-human transactions and agreements that make the Unix culture so effective at what it does.

Because this is a book about shared culture, I never planned to write it alone. You will notice that the text includes guest appearances by prominent Unix developers, the shapers of the Unix tradition. The book went through an extended public review process during which I invited these luminaries to comment on and argue with the text. Rather than submerging the results of that review process in the final version, these guests were encouraged to speak with their own voices, amplifying and developing and even disagreeing with the main line of the text.

In this book, when I use the editorial {\textquoteleft}we{\textquoteright} it is not to pretend omniscience but to reflect the fact that it attempts to articulate the expertise of an entire community.

Because this book is aimed at transmitting culture, it includes much more in the way of history and folklore and asides than is normal for a technical book. Enjoy; these things, too, are part of your education as a Unix programmer. No single one of the historical details is vital, but the gestalt of them all is important. We think it makes a more interesting story this way. More importantly, understanding where Unix came from and how it got the way it is will help you develop an intuitive feel for the Unix style.

For the same reason, we refuse to write as if history is over. You will find an unusually large number of references to the time of writing in this book. We do not wish to pretend that current practice reflects some sort of timeless and perfectly logical outcome of preordained destiny. References to time of writing are meant as an alert to the reader two or three or five years hence that the associated statements of fact may have become dated and should be double-checked.

Other things this book is not is neither a C tutorial, nor a guide to the Unix commands and API. It is not a reference for sed or yacc or Perl or Python. It's not a network programming primer, nor an exhaustive guide to the mysteries of X. It's not a tour of Unix's internals and architecture, either. Other books cover these specifics better, and this book points you at them as appropriate.

Beyond all these technical specifics, the Unix culture has an unwritten engineering tradition that has developed over literally millions of man-years[1] of skilled effort. This book is written in the belief that understanding that tradition, and adding its design patterns to your toolkit, will help you become a better programmer and designer.

Cultures consist of people, and the traditional way to learn Unix culture is from other people and through the folklore, by osmosis. This book is not a substitute for person-to-person acculturation, but it can help accelerate the process by allowing you to tap the experience of others.},

	abstract = {This thesis presents a general-purpose software defined radio architecture, Surfer, which has been designed to allow for dynamic modification of system behavior during runtime. Surfer leverages commodity processing devices such as those on a typical laptop to allow heterogeneous processing. This heterogeneity is enabled through the use of one or more signal processing implementations, or flavors, per block. Each flavor can target a different processing device, and flavors can be swapped during runtime without interrupting data flow. Two waveform programming interfaces are provided that can be intermixed for waveform definition: traditional block-centric programming, and a buffer-centric approach such as that found in MATLAB. Within a waveform graph consisting of processing blocks, each connection is a buffer that holds the data being generated by one block and consumed by others. Each connection is paired with a threshold on the amount of data in the buffer, and is used for scheduling. Runtime statistics allow a system supervisor to assist in mapping and scheduling, dynamically during runtime, in order to meet waveform requirements. This work demonstrates that it is both possible and useful to implement dynamic reconfiguration, mapping, and scheduling during runtime on commodity hardware, entirely in software. These capabilities are demonstrated via an OFDM transmitter implementation.},

Modern applications are, however, driving demand for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), rekindling interest in the performance of shorter, higher-rate error correcting codes, and raising the possibility of revisiting universal, code-agnostic decoders. To that end, here we introduce a soft-detection variant of Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) called Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND that can accurately decode any moderate redundancy block-code. It is designed with efficient circuit implementation in mind, and determines accurate decodings while retaining the original hard detection GRAND algorithm's suitability for a highly parallelized implementation in hardware. ORBGRAND is shown to provide excellent soft decision block error performance for codes of distinct classes (BCH, CA-Polar and RLC) with modest complexity, while providing better block error rate performance than CA-SCL, a state of the art soft detection CA-Polar decoder. ORBGRAND offers the possibility of an accurate, energy efficient soft detection decoder suitable for delivering URLLC in a single hardware realization.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves and in the first imaging of a black hole. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) as one of the main objectives of 5G development to satisfy the applications with stringent requirements of latency and reliability. Uplink (UL) configured-grant (CG) transmission where the user equipment (UE) transmits a packet without scheduling request (SR) and UL grant is standardized by 3GPP Release 15 to reduce latency. The UE also transmits automatically a configured number of repetitions without feedback from the base station (gNB) to increase reliability.Nevertheless, the repetitions are not allowed to transmit outside the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) process containing the first repetition. It might cause a smaller number of transmitted repetitions than configuration that is harmful to the performance of URLLC.This paper uses the reserved resources where the UEs can transmit the repetitions outside the original HARQ process until the configured number is reached. The scheme is developed further when the gNB is equipped with a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver so it can decode multiple repetitions of the different UEs in the same reserved resource. The use of reserved resources ensures the performance of UL CG transmission while SIC receiver minimizes the reserved resource's consumption. The numerical results show a higher transmission reliability and lower reserved resource consumption of the proposed scheme compared to the related works.},

	abstract = {While the notion of age of information (AoI) has recently emerged as an important concept for analyzing ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), the majority of the existing works have focused on the average AoI measure. However, an average AoI based design falls short in properly characterizing the performance of URLLC systems as it cannot account for extreme events that occur with very low probabilities. In contrast, in this paper, the main objective is to go beyond the traditional notion of average AoI by characterizing and optimizing a URLLC system while capturing the AoI tail distribution. In particular, the problem of vehicles' power minimization while ensuring stringent latency and reliability constraints in terms of probabilistic AoI is studied. To this end, a novel and efficient mapping between both AoI and queue length distributions is proposed. Subsequently, extreme value theory (EVT) and Lyapunov optimization techniques are adopted to formulate and solve the problem. Simulation results shows a nearly two-fold improvement in terms of shortening the tail of the AoI distribution compared to a baseline whose design is based on the maximum queue length among vehicles, when the number of vehicular user equipment (VUE) pairs is 80. The results also show that this performance gain increases significantly as the number of VUE pairs increases.},

With non-zero survival time, a feedback based survival mode is possible, where the network incorporates additional robustness if the previous transmission was not received. We consider the tradeoff between reliability of normal mode and survival mode transmission, and analyze the effect of feedback errors on these. We formulate an optimization to minimize average resource usage, guaranteeing time critical quality of service (QoS), and show numerical results in scenarios with typical system assumptions. For a user with a Rayleigh fading channel, average signal-to-noise ratio 10 dB, and control channel error probability 10-3, optimization based on judiciously choosing survival and normal mode reliability targets can reduce resource usage needed to guarantee QoS with a factor of 30.},

In the era of the Internet of things (IoT), billions of sensors, machines, vehicles, drones, and robots will be connected, making the world around us smarter. The IoT will encompass devices that must wirelessly communicate a diverse set of data gathered from the environment for myriad new applications. The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions that improve quality of life and generate new revenue. Providing large-scale, long-lasting, reliable, and near real-time connectivity is the major challenge in enabling a smart connected world. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on existing and emerging communication solutions for serving IoT applications in the context of cellular, wide-area, as well as non-terrestrial networks. Specifically, wireless technology enhancements for providing IoT access in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, and communication networks over the unlicensed spectrum are presented. Aligned with the main key performance indicators of 5G and beyond 5G networks, we investigate solutions and standards that enable energy efficiency, reliability, low latency, and scalability (connection density) of current and future IoT networks. The solutions include grant-free access and channel coding for short-packet communications, non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence. Further, a vision of new paradigm shifts in communication networks in the 2030s is provided, and the integration of the associated new technologies like artificial intelligence, non-terrestrial networks, and new spectra is elaborated. In particular, the potential of using emerging deep learning and federated learning techniques for enhancing the efficiency and security of IoT communication are discussed, and their promises and challenges are introduced. Finally, future research directions toward beyond 5G IoT networks are pointed out.},

In this paper we present the NeuroRAN architecture, which leverages stateful function as a user facing execution model, and is complemented with virtualized resources and decentralized resource management. We show that neural network based implementations of common transceiver functional blocks fit the proposed architecture, and we discuss key research challenges related to compilation and code generation, resource management, reliability and security.},

In the established information processing approach, the algorithmic tasks are executed on discrete messages and the processing steps are designed to optimize the mutual information. In this paper, we extend the concept of information optimized processing for exploiting diversity. To that end, we propose the Relative Entropy based Message Combining (REMC) approach in order to merge discrete messages with different underlying distributions, e.g., stemming from different diversity branches. We exemplary evaluate the proposed REMC for a single-user uplink-model with multiple Radio Access Points (RAPs) and higher order modulation schemes. The numerical results show that message combining is required to leverages diversity gains in an information optimized receiver.},

Although the theoretical research is blooming, with many interesting results presented, hardware and system development for CR is progressing at a slower pace. We provide synopses of the commonly used platforms and testbeds, examine what has been achieved in the last decade of experimentation and trials relating to CR, and draw several perhaps surprising conclusions.

While SDN has been widely exploited in the core network side, it still remains an open research question in the Radio Access Network (RAN). Initial works highlight the benefits of SDN in RAN and investigate the idea of separating the control plane from the data plane of the Base Stations (BS) by means of SDN. The pioneer Software-Defined RAN (SD-RAN) controllers are available, nonetheless there exist no tools which can shed light on their performance and help to understand their limitations. We introduce SDRBench, a novel SD-RAN controller benchmark tool to fill this void. In this work, we evaluate FlexRAN, which is the first open source SD-RAN platform. In our tool, a Python-based instance of a FlexRAN agent is created and it communicates messages with the controller according to the FlexRAN protocol. The benchmark is used to uncover the limits of the SD-RAN controller.},

We fill this void with FlexRAN, a flexible and programmable SD-RAN platform that separates the RAN control and data planes through a new, custom-tailored southbound API. Aided by virtualized control functions and control delegation features, FlexRAN provides a flexible control plane designed with support for real-time RAN control applications, flexibility to realize various degrees of coordination among RAN infrastructure entities, and programmability to adapt control over time and easier evolution to the future following SDN/NFV principles. We implement FlexRAN as an extension to a modified version of the OpenAirInterface LTE platform, with evaluation results indicating the feasibility of using FlexRAN under the stringent time constraints posed by the RAN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexRAN as an SD-RAN platform and highlight its applicability for a diverse set of use cases, we present three network services deployed over FlexRAN focusing on interference management, mobile edge computing and RAN sharing.},

Network softwarization and network function virtualization have been introduced to tackle these problems, aiming at decreasing costs and complexity of implementing new services, maintaining the implemented services, and managing available resources in service provisioning platforms and underlying infrastructures. To experience the full potential of these approaches, innovative development support tools and service provisioning environments are needed. To answer these needs, we introduce the architecture of the open-source SONATA system, a service programming, orchestration, and management framework. We present a development toolchain for virtualized network services, fully integrated with a service platform and orchestration system. We introduce the modular and flexible architecture of our system and discuss its main components and features, such as function- and service-specific managers that allow fine-grained service management, slicing support to facilitate multi-tenancy, recursiveness for improved scalability, and full-featured DevOps support.},

	abstract = {With an increased utilization of large sensor networks in applications such as environmental monitoring, hazard detection and health care, the methodology of a data processing within the network has been identified as a promising concept. While common approaches rely on centralized processing, in-network processing exploits the interconnections among the nodes to obtain a cooperative result. By that, the network is equipped with estimation capabilities and an increased robustness against node failures within the network. Corresponding algorithms have been widely developed in the literature. However, the majority of these consider linear functions only whereas usually physical phenomena such as the spatial distribution of temperature, humidity, altitude or radioactivity are described by nonlinear functions. Hence, existing in-network processing algorithms will perform poorly when applied to the spatial reconstruction of such physical quantities. To suggest solutions to this issue this thesis aims at deriving algorithms that enable a distributed estimation and regression of nonlinear functions.

Within this thesis two core algorithms are proposed that achieve the aforementioned objective by a combination of concepts from kernel methods, set theoretic adaptive filtering and in-network processing. Simulative analyses of the proposed schemes for synthetic data as well as real altitude data show their capability for a distributed reconstruction of nonlinear functions. To enable a comprehensive study of the presented material this thesis provides insights to recent advances in kernel-based estimation, kernel adaptive filtering algorithms and distributed consensus-based schemes.},

Furthermore, a spectrum distance SD0 (SD1) and a joint spectrum distance (JSD) are presented as performance criteria to optimize the puncturing tables. For the capacity-zero puncturing mode (punctured bits are unknown to the decoder), we propose a quasi-uniform puncturing algorithm, analyze the number of equivalent puncturings and prove that this scheme can maximize SD1 and JSD. Similarly, for the capacity-one mode (punctured bits are known to the decoder), we also devise a reversal quasi-uniform puncturing scheme and prove that it has the maximum SD0 and JSD. Both schemes have a universal puncturing table without any exhausted search. These optimal RCPP codes outperform the performance of turbo codes in LTE wireless communication systems.},

	abstract = {Polar codes represent one of the major recent breakthroughs in coding theory and, because of their attractive features, they have been selected for the incoming 5G standard. As such, a lot of attention has been devoted to the development of decoding algorithms with good error performance and efficient hardware implementation. One of the leading candidates in this regard is represented by successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding. However, its hardware implementation requires a large amount of memory. Recently, a partitioned SCL (PSCL) decoder has been proposed to significantly reduce the memory consumption [2]. In this paper, we consider the paradigm of PSCL decoding from a practical standpoint and we provide several impro- vements. First, by changing the target signal-to-noise ratio and consequently modifying the construction of the code [3], we are able to improve the performance at no additional computational, latency or memory cost. Second, we bridge the performance gap between SCL and PSCL decoding by introducing a generalized PSCL (GPSCL) decoder and a layered PSCL (LPSCL) decoder. In this way, we obtain almost the same performance of the SCL decoder with a significantly lower memory requirement, as testified by hardware implementation results. Third, we present an optimal scheme to allocate cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). Finally, we provide a lower bound on the list size that guarantees optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) performance for the binary erasure channel (BEC).},

Recently, we know that partial order is a universal property of the construction with a sublinear complexity for polar codes. In order to describe the partial order, addition and left-swap operators are only defined as universal up to now. In this study, we first propose \$1+{\textbackslash}backslashlog\_2 {\textbackslash}backslashlog\_2 N\$ universal operators to describe multiple partial order for the block length \$N=2{\textasciicircum}n\$. By using these operators, some known antichains can be universally ordered. Furthermore, by using a simple geometric property of Gaussian approximation, we define an attractor that is a pre-defined subset of synthetic channels. They are universally less reliable than the natural channel \$W\$. Then, we show that the cardinality of this attractor is \$(n+2)\$-th Fibonacci number which is a significantly large number of channels for long codes. The main contribution is that there are significant number of synthetic channels explicitly defined as almost useless by the help of attractor and multiple partial order. As a result, proposed attractor with multiple partial order can be seen as an efficient tool to investigate and design extremely long codes.},

Especially, the strong penetration of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) into the communications standards has triggered heavy investigation on multicarrier systems, leading to re-consideration of different approaches as an alternative to OFDM. The goal of the present survey is not only to provide a unified review of waveform design options for multicarrier schemes, but also to pave the way for the evolution of the multicarrier schemes from the current state of the art to future technologies. In particular, a generalized framework on multicarrier schemes is presented, based on what to transmit, i.e., symbols, how to transmit, i.e., filters, and where/when to transmit, i.e., lattice. Capitalizing on this framework, different variations of orthogonal, bi-orthogonal, and nonorthogonal multicarrier schemes are discussed. In addition, filter design for various multicarrier systems is reviewed considering four different design perspectives: energy concentration, rapid decay, spectrum nulling, and channel/hardware characteristics. Subsequently, evaluation tools which may be used to compare different filters in multicarrier schemes are studied. Finally, multicarrier schemes are evaluated from the view of the practical implementation issues, such as lattice adaptation, equalization, synchronization, multiple antennas, and hardware impairments.},

	abstract = {Future generation cellular networks are expected to provide ubiquitous broadband access to a continuously growing number of mobile users. In this context, LTE systems repre- sent an important milestone towards the so called 4G cellular networks. A key feature of LTE is the adoption of advanced Radio ResourceManagement procedures in order to increase the system performance up to the Shannon limit. Packet scheduling mechanisms, in particular, play a fundamental role, because they are responsible for choosing, with fine time and frequency resolu- tions, how to distribute radio resources among different stations, taking into account channel condition and QoS requirements. This goal should be accomplished by providing, at the same time, an optimal trade-off between spectral efficiency and fairness. In this context, this paper provides an overview on the key issues that arise in the design of a resource allocation algorithm for LTE networks. It is intended for a wide range of readers as it covers the topic from basics to advanced aspects. The downlink channel under frequency division duplex configuration is considered as object of our study, but most of the considerations are valid for other configurations as well. Moreover, a survey on the most recent techniques is reported, including a classification of the different approaches presented in literature. Performance comparisons of the most well-known schemes, with particular focus on QoS provisioning capabilities, are also provided for complementing the described concepts. Thus, this survey would be useful for readers interested in learning the basic concepts before going into the details of a particular scheduling strategy, as well as for researchers aiming at deepening more specific aspects.},

These detection methods are more complex than energy detection but they have better detection performance in low-SNR regimes. The drawback, however, is their extensive computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient spectrum sensing method for detecting unsynchronized OFDM signals in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The proposed method exploits the second-order CS property of OFDM signals to set an adaptive threshold, which achieves the desired constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property. The complexity of the proposed method is significantly reduced compared with the scheme proposed in [22]. Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate that the performance of the proposed detector outperforms the classical energy detector (ED), the sliding window detector (SW) and Axell's detector in addition to guaranteeing a low sensing time.},

	abstract = {URLLC use cases demand a new paradigm in cellular networks to contend with the extreme requirements with complex trade-offs. In general, it is exceptionally challenging and, resource usage-wise, prohibitively expensive to satisfy the URLLC requirements using the existing approaches in LTE. To address these challenges 3GPP has recently agreed to adopt PD of both UP and CP packets as a fundamental technique in 5G NR. This article investigates the theoretic framework behind PD and provides a primer on the recent enhancements applied in the NR RAN architecture for supporting URLLC. It is shown that PD enables jointly satisfying the latency and reliability requirements without increasing the complexity in the RAN. With dynamic control capability, PD can be used not only for URLLC but also to increase the transmission robustness during mobility and against radio link failures. The article also provides numerical results comparing the performance of PD in various deployment scenarios. The numerical results reveal that in certain scenarios, performing PD over multiple links results in lower usage of radio resources than using a single highly reliable link. It is also found that to improve radio resource utilization while satisfying URLLC requirements, enabling PD in scenarios such as cell edge is crucial where the average SNR of the best (primary) link and the variation in SNR between all accessible links is typically low. In essence, the PD technique provides a cost-effective solution for satisfying the URLLC requirements without requiring major modifications to the RAN deployments.},

We also identify all the puncturing bit patterns yielding a given incapable bit pattern. These results provide a guidance to design a practical rate-matching scheme for polar codes.

Distributed iterative detection (DID) is an interference mitigation technique in which the base stations at different geographical locations exchange detected data iteratively while performing separate detection and decoding of their received data streams. This paper explores possible DID receive strategies and proposes to exchange between base stations only the processed information for their associated mobile terminals. The resulting backhaul traffic is considerably lower than that of existing cooperative multiuser detection strategies. Single-antenna interference cancellation techniques are employed to generate local estimates of the dominant interferers at each base station, which are then combined with their independent received copies from other base stations, resulting in more effective interference suppression. Since hard information bits or quantized log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) are transferred, we investigate the effect of quantization of the LLR values with the objective of further reducing the backhaul traffic. Our findings show that schemes based on nonuniform quantization of the soft bits allow for reducing the backhaul to 1-2 exchanged bits/coded bit.},

	abstract = {Polar codes represent an emerging class of error-correcting codes with power to approach the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel. This overview article aims to illustrate its principle, generation and decoding techniques. Unlike the traditional capacity-approaching coding strategy that tries to make codes as random as possible, the polar codes follow a different philosophy, also originated by Shannon, by creating a jointly typical set. Channel polarization, a concept central to polar codes, is intuitively elaborated by a Matthew effect in the digital world, followed by a detailed overview of construction methods for polar encoding. The butterfly structure of polar codes introduces correlation among source bits, justifying the use of the SC algorithm for efficient decoding. The SC decoding technique is investigated from the conceptual and practical viewpoints. State-of-the-art decoding algorithms, such as the BP and some generalized SC decoding, are also explained in a broad framework. Simulation results show that the performance of polar codes concatenated with CRC codes can outperform that of turbo or LDPC codes. Some promising research directions in practical scenarios are also discussed in the end.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of complex wireless systems through simulations is commonly tackled with an abstraction of physical link behavior. This procedure is performed in 2 phases: Firstly, training is performed at the link level, resulting in a mapping function from signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to block error rate (BLER); and secondly, physical layer signal processing is replaced by the resulting link-level mapping function. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for link abstraction. The well-known exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM) is likely to be the most extensively used procedure for mul-ticarrier transmission. In short, EESM estimates an effective SINR from the whole set of SINRs of useful subcarriers by means of a single parameter mapping function, which must be previously optimized through training. Later on, BLER is assumed as that of the effective SINR over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. In this paper, we propose a novel method for BLER prediction named as logistic regression-based link method (LRLM). Mean and standard deviation of the SINR set can accurately capture BLER behavior for wideband multicarrier systems through a simpler function, thus reducing the amount of information to be stored compared to EESM. Moreover, LRLM is very flexible and may include extra predictors to reduce the number of different models to be stored. Performance results show that LRLM is able to predict accurately the BLER for all modulation and coding schemes and transport block sizes defined for Long-Term Evolution technology.},

We show how density evolution can be used to develop a channel-specific method to design outer codes of length L under maximum likelihood decoding. Once a bank of outer codes of length L and different rates have been designed, we develop a rate-allocation algorithm to allocate rates to the outer codes of the GCC code with the goal of minimizing the overall block error rate for a given overall rate of K/N. To maintain the low complexity of the SC decoder we only design very short outer codes (L {\textbackslash}textless 8). We show that at this outer code lengths it is possible to design GCC-polar codes that can result in up to 0:5 dB coding gain while reducing decoding complexity.},

A polar code construction is any algo-rithm that selects K best among N possible polar bit-channels at the design signal-to-noise-ratio (design-SNR) in terms of bit error rate (BER). Optimal polar code construction is hard and therefore many suboptimal polar code constructions have been proposed at different computational complexities. Polar codes are also non-universal meaning the code changes significantly with the design-SNR. However, it is not known which construction algorithm at what design-SNR constructs the best polar codes. We first present a comprehensive survey of all the well-known polar code constructions along with their full implementations. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to find the best design-SNR for constructing best possible polar codes from a given construction algorithm. The proposed algorithm involves a search among several possible design-SNRs. We finally use our algorithm to perform a comparison of different construction algorithms using extensive simulations. We find that all polar code construction algorithms generate equally good polar codes in an AWGN channel, if the design-SNR is optimized.},

However when the code length is long, the subchannel selection inaccuracy due to the calculation error of conventional approximate GA (AGA), which uses a two-segment approximation function, results in a catastrophic performance loss. In this paper, new principles to design the GA approximation functions for polar codes are proposed. First, we introduce the concepts of polarization violation set (PVS) and polarization reversal set (PRS) to explain the essential reasons that the conventional AGA scheme cannot work well for the long-length polar code construction. In fact, these two sets will lead to the rank error of subsequent subchannels, which means the orders of subchannels are misaligned, which is a severe problem for polar code construction. Second, we propose a new metric, named cumulative-logarithmic error (CLE), to quantitatively evaluate the remainder approximation error of AGA in logarithm. We derive the upper bound of CLE to simplify its calculation. Finally, guided by PVS, PRS and CLE bound analysis, we propose new construction rules based on a multi-segment approximation function, which obviously improve the calculation accuracy of AGA so as to ensure the excellent performance of polar codes especially for the long code lengths. Numerical and simulation results indicate that the proposed AGA schemes are critical to construct the high-performance polar codes.},

This scenario presents multiple challenges in terms of radio resource scheduling, link adaptation and inter-cell interference, which are identified and addressed throughout the paper. We propose a joint link adaptation and resource allocation policy that dynamically adjusts the block error probability (BLEP) of URLLC small payload transmissions in accordance with the instantaneous experienced load per cell. Extensive system-level simulations of the downlink performance show promising gains of this technique, reducing the URLLC latency from 1.3 ms to 1 ms at the 99.999\&\#x0025; percentile, with less than 10\&\#x0025; degradation of the eMBB throughput performance as compared to conventional scheduling policies. Moreover, an exhaustive sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the URLLC and eMBB performance under different offered loads, URLLC payload sizes, and link adaptation and scheduling strategies. The presented results give valuable insights on the maximum URLLC offered traffic load that can be tolerated while still satisfying the URLLC requirements, as well as what conditions are more appropriate for dynamic multiplexing of URLLC and eMBB traffic in the upcoming 5G systems.},

Especially for two phase two way relaying channels (TWRC) where two users simultaneously transmit data on the same resources, a robust design in presence of practical constraints is important. This paper focuses on the equalization at the relay with factor graph based techniques reducing the impact of the physical channels and offsets. The combination of general waveforms and factor graph based equalizers offers a flexible structure giving control of the complexity and FER performance at the relay. Hence, we fully describe a TWRC transmission by factor graphs for general multi-carrier transmissions, which gives us a framework on iterative detection of the relay message based on the sum-product algorithm. It turns out that well localized waveforms applying a factor graph based equalizer outperforms OFDM w.r.t. FER performance under practical constraints.},

This leads to the integration of more complex algorithms and involving multiple sensors and mobile assets for a more flexible and intelligent motion control. The requirement on computing power becomes often higher than it could be performed on the robot controller itself. Using an external computer introduces, nowadays, significant communication delays that make real-time control difficult or even impossible. Furthermore, to integrate mobile assets in a motion control scenario wired communication cannot be employed. A 5G network / local factory cloud may bridge this gap. In this paper we describe why 5G technology can make a significant contribution to enable new types of industrial robotics applications. Moreover, we present various use cases and discuss simulation results of a 5G-based robotics application in an industrial environment.},

	abstract = {Wireless 5G systems will not only be "4G, but faster". One of the novel features discussed in relation to 5G is Ultra-Reliable Communication (URC), an operation mode not present in today's wireless systems. URC refers to provision of certain level of communication service almost 100 \% of the time. Example URC applications include reliable cloud connectivity, critical connections for industrial automation and reliable wireless coordination among vehicles. This paper puts forward a systematic view on URC in 5G wireless systems. It starts by analyzing the fundamental mechanisms that constitute a wireless connection and concludes that one of the key steps towards enabling URC is revision of the methods for encoding control information (metadata) and data. It introduces the key concept of Reliable Service Composition, where a service is designed to adapt its requirements to the level of reliability that can be attained. The problem of URC is analyzed across two different dimensions. The first dimension is the type of URC problem that is defined based on the time frame used to measure the reliability of the packet transmission. Two types of URC problems are identified: long-term URC (URC-L) and short-term URC (URC-S). The second dimension is represented by the type of reliability impairment that can affect the communication reliability in a given scenario. The main objective of this paper is to create the context for defining and solving the new engineering problems posed by URC in 5G.},

At the time of writing, we implemented all the necessary functions to support basic downlink functionality at both gNB and UE showing the feasibility to run 5G NR in real-time on a software defined radio platform.

	abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal \$x{\textbackslash}in X\$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal \$y{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Y\$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \${\textbackslash}X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \${\textbackslash}X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \${\textbackslash}Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \${\textbackslash}X\$ provides about \${\textbackslash}Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \${\textbackslash}tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,{\textbackslash}x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \${\textbackslash}X\$ and \${\textbackslash}Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}tX\$ and \${\textbackslash}tX {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

Based on a set of measurements in a factory hall, we find that the abundance of metallic scatterers causes dense multipath scattering. This can be seen to produce mostly a Rayleigh distributed small-scale fading signal, with only a few paths exhibiting Nakagami distributions. For the power delay profile, we suggest a generalization of the Saleh-Valenzuela model where clusters with different excess delays have different ray power decay constants; the decay constants follow a linear dependence on the delay. This model provides an excellent fit to the measured data. We also note that for non-line-of-sight scenarios at larger distances, several hundred multipath components need to be collected to capture 50\% of the available energy.},

Low cost high performance DSP chips promote delivery of enhanced communications services as software radios. Time to incorporate a new service into a product is reduced dramatically using this approach. Low costs and new services will continue to increase demand for software radio tool sets and CAD environments. This paper relates performance of enabling hardware technologies to software radio requirements, portending a decade of shift from hardware radios toward software intensive approaches. Such approaches require efficient use of computational resources through topological consistency of radio functions and host architectures. This leads to a layered topology oriented design approach encapsulated in a canonical Open Architecture Software Radio model. This model underscores challenges in simulation and computer aided design tools for radio engineering. It also provides a unified mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of algorithm structures, host architectures and system performance for radio engineering CAD environments of the 90's.},

We propose to pulse shape the OFDM signals using time-frequency localized prototype filters. This improves the robustness of the waveform against timing offsets, so that the uplink transmission procedure can be simplified. Building on that property, an asynchronous uplink access scheme is developed. In the performance evaluation, we compare with both DFTs-OFDM and CP-OFDM schemes and demonstrate that higher spectral efficiency can be achieved by the pulse shaped OFDM scheme, highlighting the benefits in properly designing the pulse shapes of a multicarrier waveform.},

In this paper, two way relaying networks using physical layer network coding utilizing a multicarrier scheme with Gaussian waveforms are analyzed. This combination is introduced to be more robust against the impact of carrier frequency offsets and timing offsets. In two way relaying a multiple access phase is applied, where both users transmit their messages simultaneously on the same resources to an assisting relay. Here, a superposition of both signals containing the influence of the individual channels is received. The additional interference introduced by the non-orthogonal Gaussian filter is treated by a linear equalizer. To reduce complexity the equalizer is simplified to treat adjacent symbols in the time-frequency grid, only. To evaluate the overall performance of the introduced equalizer, different decoding strategies are analyzed by means of a link level simulations.},

A relaxation of timing and frequency alignment requirements is taken into account for supporting applications like Machine Type Communications (MTC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper contains a first uplink comparison scenario where traffic with Relaxed Synchronicity (RS) is embedded into synchronous traffic. Two main users of interest are either using IDMA or FDMA on top of either OFDM or UFMC modulation. Simulation results give first suitability indications for 5G for the combination of waveform and multiple access scheme.

The proposed scheme is compared to receiver concepts from previous work and the performance is assessed in terms of bit error rates for AWGN and Rayleigh multipath fading channels.

Its inherent self-interference makes receiver design challenging, particularly when besides inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) also inter-antenna interference (IAI) occurs, as in systems that employ spatial multiplexing (SM) to increase the throughput. To encounter this interference, we apply the prominent minimum mean squared error with parallel interference cancellation (MMSE-PIC) iterative receiver structure to GFDM, and provide a formulation that is suitable for a low-complexity implementation. We analyze the decoding performance employing a well-known current WiMax LDPC code. The proposed demapping algorithm can be implemented with complexity that scales linearly with the number of subcarriers of the system. Analysis of information transfer characteristics shows that the MMSE-PIC demapper for GFDM exhibits potential to outperform the OFDM demapper with a matching code, however, simulations of frame error rate (FER) show inferior performance of GFDM. These results emphasize the importance of a joint waveform and code design in order to exploit the full potential of the MMSE-PIC receiver structure for GFDM.},

However, it is uncertain how short, polar-coded packets with BICM in OFDM systems at low FER can be characterized via ESM. We investigate if and how short packet communication systems with polar codes can be modeled accurately via ESM methods. We compare new error measures for FER curve fitting in order to find optimal ESM adjustment factors for low FERs.

The network simulator ns-3 specifies two error rate models for the calculation of the bit error rates and corresponding packet error rates for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, the YANS [1] and NIST [2] error rate models. In [2] both models are validated and the NIST model is recommended for the calculations because of the overly optimistic results in the YANS model. However, still some inaccuracies are present in both of the models which shortly have been discussed in [3], where also a new model has been briefly sketched. In this work, the new model initially proposed in [3] is outlined in detail, including a full discussion of the differences to the prior models in [1] and [2]. Additionally, corrections for the inaccuracies in the YANS [1] and the NIST [2] models are proposed. The upper bounds for the packet success rate, calculated with the new model as well as with the corrected versions of the YANS [1] and the NIST [2] models are compared with an exact physical layer simulation using Matlab and with measurements over an AWGN channel with a typical IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless LAN module. Thereby the new model leads to results that are consistent with exact simulations of the IEEE 802.11a PHY and being comparable to real hardware performance. Showing the importance of a correct abstraction of the physical layer, finally the influences on network simulation results of the three models are evaluated in a ns-3 simulation covering a hidden node scenario as an example of a typical WLAN network problem.},

GFDM is based on traditional filter bank multi-branch multi- carrier concepts which are now implemented digitally. Our GFDM approach exhibits some attractive features which are of particular importance for scenarios exhibiting high degrees of spectrum fragmentation. Spectrum fragmentation is a typical technical challenge of digital dividend use cases, exploiting spectrum white spaces in the TV UHF bands which are located in close proximity to allocated spectrum. Specifically, the GFDM features are a lower PAPR compared to OFDM, a ultra-low out-of- band radiation due adjustable Tx-filtering and last but not least a block-based transmission using cyclic prefix insertion and efficient FFT-based equalization. GFDM enables frequency and time domain multi-user scheduling comparable to OFDM and provides an efficient alternative for white space aggregation even in heavily fragmented spectrum regions.},

First, we give an alternative proof of an existing PO for bit-channels with the same Hamming weight and use the underlying idea to extend the bit-channel ordering to some additional cases. In particular, the bit-channel ordering for a given code block length is used to generate additional bit-channel ordering relationships for larger block lengths, generalizing previously known POs. Next, we consider POs especially for the binary erasure channel (BEC). We identify a symmetry property of the Bhattacharyya parameters of complementary bit-channel pairs on the BEC and provide a condition for the alignment of polarized sets of bit-channels for the BEC and general binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. Numerical examples and further properties about the POs for the bit-channels with different Hamming weights are provided to illustrate the new POs. The bit-channels with universal ordering positions, which are independent of the channel erasure probability, are verified for all of the code block lengths. Finally, we show the threshold behavior of the Bhattacharyya parameters of some bit-channels by approximating the threshold values. The corresponding value for a bit-channel can be used to determine whether it is good or bad when the underlying channel is known.},

Thus, modifications of OFDM, such as windowing or filtering, become necessary. Alternatively, we can employ a different modulation scheme, such as filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC). In this paper, we provide a unifying framework, discussion, and performance evaluation of FBMC and compare it with OFDM-based schemes. Our investigations are not only based on simulations, but are substantiated by real-world testbed measurements and trials, where we show that multiple antennas and channel estimation, two of the main challenges associated with FBMC, can be efficiently dealt with. In addition, we derive closed-form solutions for the signal-to-interference ratio in doubly-selective channels and show that in many practical cases, one-tap equalizers are sufficient.

Specifically, a method for synthesizing spectrally well-localized uplink waveforms with low peak-to-average power ratio, using FB based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation in combination with FB spreading, is introduced. Secondly, the superior frequency selectivity of the FB approach, when combined with frequency sampling -designed subchannel/subband processing, is found to enable flexible and bandwidth efficient multi-mode uplink transmission with relaxed constraints on inter-user timing synchronization. The proposed concept allows different mobile terminals to operate in the reverse link simultaneously in multicarrier, SC-FDMA, or conventional single carrier mode according to attributes such as the required transmission power.},

To reduce the latency of SCAN, in this paper we identify special nodes in the decoding tree, corresponding to specific frozen-bit sequences, and propose dedicated low-latency decoding approaches for each of them. The resulting fast-SCAN decoder does not alter the soft-output compared to the standard SCAN while dramatically reducing the decoding latency and yielding the same error correction performance.},

To evaluate its performance, its capacity limits are of particular importance. Therefore, this paper analyzes its constellation-constrained capacities for cases where the channel state information (CSI) is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. In frequency selective channels, GFDM may provide advantage over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. In order to achieve near-capacity performance, the interaction of data symbols in time and frequency combined with multiple antennas (MIMO) challenges the design of GFDM receivers. This paper therefore applies expectation propagation (EP) for systematic receiver design. It is shown that the resulting iterative MIMO-GFDM receiver with affordable complexity can approach optimum decoding performance and outperform MIMO-OFDM in a rich multipath environment. Simulations are also used to illustrate the impact of channel delay spread on the constellation-constrained capacities and on the performance of the novel receiver algorithm.},

We name this novel combination Multicarrier CS-MUD (MCSM). Previous investigations on CS-MUD facilitates massive direct random access by exploiting the signal sparsity caused by sporadic sensor activity. The new combined scheme MCSM with its flexibility in accessing time frequency resources additionally allows for either reducing the number of subcarriers or shortening the multicarrier symbol duration, i.e., we gain a high spectral efficiency.

Code construction parameters, number of iterations, and list sizes are selected to provide a fair comparison among candidate coding schemes. Simulation results on BLER are shown for several code rates and small-to-moderate block sizes. The results reveal that polar and LDPC codes outperform turbo codes for short block sizes of 40 bits, while the opposite is true for medium block sizes of 200 bits. None of the schemes is a clear winner at all considered block sizes and coding rates. Other aspects like implementation complexity, latency, and flexibility will also be important when deciding the URLLC coding scheme.},

	abstract = {Complex control algorithms base on the measurements of distributed sensors and the execution by distributed actuators. Consequently, communication networks are a vital part of modern automation applications. Currently, data are often exchanged using wired Industrial Ethernet networks, while the trend is moving towards wireless communication networks, as they provide flexible, mobile communication by retrofittable components.

This trend entails the necessity to formally test the performance of a communication network, as the quantitative key performance indicators of wireless technologies are typically smaller than of wired technologies. By this performance testing, a suitable technology is identified ahead of its implementation in a real application environment. But formal performance testing must base on precisely defined communication requirements, as only this allows a meaningful assessment of the testing results. However, these specifications are currently not available, although the specification of industrial automation applications{\textquoteright} communication requirements is now being discussed for more than a decade.

By reviewing the discussion of communication requirements, this paper clarifies, why the specification of requirements is complex and provides the reader with necessary information enabling to follow and to join the ongoing discussion. Furthermore, a promising approach mitigating the current challenges is presented. The proposed approach is of interest to developers of automation algorithms, since the algorithms implicitly assume the existence of a suitable communication technology. The proposed approach enables developers to easily fit their specific control application to a given requirement profile by comparing the given and the target characteristic parameters. This paper intends to sensitize with regard to taking the communication needs into account when developing automation algorithms.},

These requirements were identified in the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) initiative as well as in 5th Generation (5G) mobile communication standardization in the form of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC).
Specifically Closed-Loop-Control (CLC) applications exhibit periodic deterministic communication with short packets. These applications require ultra low latency which bars the application of retransmissions to improve reliability. Also, many CLC applications are very sensitive to burst errors but can tolerate single packet loss. Therefore, we propose to shift the focus from sum-rate maximization to burst error minimization. As a first step, we perform an extensive burst error analysis of state of the art scheduling and Resource Allocation (RA) strategies. We show that any dynamic RA outperforms a static RA by a large margin.},

Unlike conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems, it is a non-orthogonal waveform subject to inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference. In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the additional inter-antenna interference also takes place. The presence of such three-dimensional interference challenges the receiver design. This paper addresses the MIMO-GFDM channel estimation problem with the aid of known reference signals also referred as pilots. Specifically, the received signal is expressed as the joint effect of the pilot part, unknown data part and noise part. On top of this formulation, least squares (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators are presented, while their performance is evaluated for various pilot arrangements.},

The 5G waveform candidate Universal Filtered OFDM (UF-OFDM) is designed to provide the flexibility required for future applications. However, the introduction of subband filters in UFMC can increase implementation complexity and low-complexity solutions need to be found. State-of-the-art technologies provide an algorithm that performs shorter-length FFTs that can reduce complexity to two to ten times that of OFDM (depending on the allocation sizes), at the cost of only approximating the exact UFMC signal. In this paper we propose a new approximation of the UFMC signal which bases on the similarity of adjacent subcarriers that can be implemented with reduced number of operations. Analysis show that the system can be implemented with only 20\% more operations than standard OFDM when accepting some increase in the subband bandwidth. A more accurate solution can be implemented at roughly 3.6 times OFDM complexity. The results can reduce implementation costs for future mobile devices.},

One of the main impediments that has limited the applicability of OFDM systems in low-power wireless communication systems is the highly variable amplitude of the baseband transmitted signal; thus, a number of previous analyses have characterized this variation. These analyses have generally employed the following two components: (1) the assumption that the complex envelope of the OFDM signal converges to a Gaussian random process in some sense as the number of subcarriers becomes large, and (2) Rice's (1945) classical results on level-crossing rates for the envelope of Gaussian random processes. In this work, we improve on both of these components to arrive at a simple, accurate, and rigorously-established expression for the peak distribution of the OFDM envelope. In particular, using a rigorous (and non-trivial) proof establishing the convergence in (1) above as justification, the modern extreme value theory for chi-squared processes is applied to the problem. Numerical results for both uncoded and coded systems establish that the simple expression obtained for the distribution of the peaks of the envelope process is extremely accurate, even for a modest number of subcarriers.},

To this aim, the model combines Mutual Information-based multi-carrier compression metrics with Link-Level performance curves matching, to obtain lookup tables that express the dependency of the Block Error Rate on the SINR values and on the modulation and coding scheme being used. In addition, we propose a 3GPP-compliant Channel Quality Indicator evaluation procedure, based on the proposed Link Abstraction Model, to be used as part of the LTE Adaptive Modulation and Coding mechanisms. Finally, we discuss how these contributions have been tested, validated and integrated in the ns-3 simulator.

	abstract = {The increasing demand for highly customized products, as well as flexible production lines, can be seen as trigger for the 'fourth industrial revolution', referred to as 'Industrie 4.0'. Current systems usually rely on wire-line technologies to connect sensors and actuators. To enable a higher flexibility such as moving robots or drones, these connections need to be replaced by wireless technologies in the future. Furthermore, this facilitates the renewal of brownfield deployments to address Industrie 4.0 requirements. This paper proposes representative use cases, which have been examined in the German Tactile Internet 4.0 (TACNET 4.0) research project. In order to analyze these use cases, this paper identifies the main challenges and requirements of communication networks in Industrie 4.0 and discusses the applicability of 5th generation wireless communication systems (5G).},

It compresses an observation to a quantized variable while attempting to preserve the mutual information shared with a relevant random variable. This paper describes a new application of the Information Bottleneck method in communications. It explains in detail, how the Information Bottleneck method can be applied to construct discrete message passing decoders for regular low-density parity-check codes. The obtained decoders process only unsigned integers and use only simple lookup tables as node operations. As a consequence, the decoders can be implemented using only unsigned integer arithmetic which makes them significantly simpler and faster than the state-of-the-art decoders which process real valued log-likelihood ratios. Anyway, included results show that the considered discrete message passing decoders perform surprisingly close to optimum message passing decoders and even outperform state-of-the-art decoders, such as the min-sum decoder. We aim to take the reader on a journey from the theoretical idea of the Information Bottleneck method to a complete design framework for the considered discrete decoders. Several included figures and examples illustrate the decoder construction process and its analysis.},

Extensive tests are conducted with respect to configured air interface specifications such as frame structure and waveform. The effect of packet size on performance is also investigated.

The explicit structure of polar codes leads to a different notion of code construction which refers to the assignment of information bits to certain positions in that structure instead of the design of the structure itself. State-of-the-art construction methods either rely on approximations or are computationally demanding to achieve an optimum assignment of the information bits. In this paper, we propose a novel construction technique which leverages the information bottleneck method to combine information-optimum construction and less complex, tractable processing of the required joint distributions. Furthermore, we consider the effect of a low-resolution channel quantizer explicitly in the code design which ensures applicability of the constructed code also in practically relevant settings.},

New equipments include more and more software radio ???capacities,??? that is, they can be reconfigured thanks to software. Certain former analog functionalities are now performed digitally. We think that the timeframe during which software radio is advantageous, compared to a velcro1 approach for multi-standard terminals, is probably over. However, software radio has taken concrete form in the military field. We show that software radio is used de facto in all equipment and products because of the technological progress to which it has led. Software radio???s legacy indeed is that it has been and still is a catalyst for wireless innovation.

Although the emphasis of the paper is on the class of FBMC systems that are based on offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM), the developed results are found applicable to cosine modulated-based FBMC systems as well. We assume that coarse CFO and timing offset estimations and compensations have already been performed so that the residual CFO and timing offset are small. A simple closed-form approximation to the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is derived. This approximation is compared numerically with the exact SIR and confirmed to be accurate for a variety of FBMC systems with different prototype filters. The derived SIR is characterized by a pair of coefficients that are only dependent on the underlying prototype filter, thus, allows the designer to pick from the choices of the prototype filter the one that has minimum sensitivity to CFO and/or timing offset. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This work presents the channel estimation for Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). GFDM can be considered as a filtered bank multicarrier scheme, where a spectrally-contained pulse shaping is applied over each subcarrier to reduce out of band radiation (OOB). However, due to pulse shaping, subcarriers in GFDM are no longer orthogonal and there is inherent interference. Due to such interference, the channel estimation for GFDM is not trivial. In this work, two channel estimation methods for GFDM are proposed, 1) Pilot Interference Cancellation (Pilot-IC) where interference is pre-canceled only at pilot symbols, 2) Transmitter IC (Tx-IC) where interference is pre-cancelled at both data and pilot symbols. With scattered pilots over frequency and time grid, this allows frequency selective and time varying fading channels to be estimated, with reduced overhead. The simulation results show that these two methods can provide the same MSE performance. Moreover, the Pilot-IC pairing with a Zero Forcing (ZF) receiver, and the Tx-IC pairing with a simple Matched Filter (MF) receiver, also provide the same BER performance. Hence, it is possible to cancel the interference either at the transmitter or the receiver.},

	abstract = {Polar coding, proposed by Arikan, makes it possible to construct capacity-achieving codes for symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels, with low encoding and decoding complexity. Complexity of the originally proposed code construction method, however, grows exponentially in the block-length unless a channel is the binary erasure channel. Recently, the authors have proposed a new capacity-achieving code construction method with linear complexity in the block-length for arbitrary symmetric binary-input memoryless channels. In this letter, we evaluate performance of polar codes designed with the new construction method, and compare it with that of the codes constructed with another heuristic method with linear complexity proposed by Arikan.},

	abstract = {In this letter, the ordered statistic decoding (OSD) is considered to decode short polar codes. Since the number of tested codewords is high in the original OSD, a threshold-based OSD is proposed to reduce the complexity. The analysis shows that the threshold affects the OSD in two ways. One is the error floor in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region while the other is the reduction of the number of tested codewords. The estimation on the BLER performance in high SNR region and the average number of tested codewords are discussed. After that, CRC-aided OSD is proposed to further improve the performance of polar codes. Simulation results show that a well-designed threshold-based OSD can reduce the complexity without significant performance loss. And a higher order OSD decoder is needed if OSD is used to decoding moderate or long polar codes. It is also illustrated that the CRC-aided OSD outperforms the CRC-aided list decoding when the code rate is high. When code rate is low, the result inverses.},

We further propose a filter design that yields non-singular modulation matrices for an even number of subcarriers and subsymbols, which is not achievable for any previous work. Such a new design has a significant impact on implementation complexity, as the radix-2 FFT operations for conventional multicarrier waveforms can readily be employed for GFDM.

Standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, using a guard-time interval or cyclic prefix, combat intersymbol interference (ISI), but provide no protection against interchannel interference (ICI). This drawback has led to the introduction of pulse-shaping OFDM systems. We first present a general framework for pulse shape design. Our analysis shows that certain pulse shapes proposed in the literature are, in fact, optimal in a well-defined sense. Furthermore, our approach provides a simple way to adapt the pulse shape to varying channel conditions. We then show that (pulse-shaping) OFDM systems based on rectangular time-frequency lattices are not optimal for time- and frequency-dispersive wireless channels. This motivates the introduction of lattice-OFDM (LOFDM) systems which are based on general time-frequency lattices. Using results from sphere packing theory, we show how to design LOFDM systems (lattice and pulse shape) optimally for timeand frequency-dispersive channels in order to minimize the joint ISI/ICI. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulations, showing that LOFDM systems outperform traditional pulse-shaping OFDM systems with respect to robustness against ISI/ICI.},

We propose a search algorithm to design good punctured polar codes, and prove that designing the optimal puncturing pattern for output bits is equivalent to finding the optimal puncturing pattern for frozen bits.

	abstract = {Polar codes are a class of linear block codes that provably achieves channel capacity, and have been selected as a coding scheme for 5th generation wireless communication standards. Successive-cancellation (SC) decoding of polar codes has mediocre error-correction performance on short to moderate codeword lengths: the SC-Flip decoding algorithm is one of the solutions that have been proposed to overcome this issue. On the other hand, SC-Flip has a higher implementation complexity compared to SC due to the required log-likelihood ratio (LLR) selection and sorting process. Moreover, it requires a high number of iterations to reach good error-correction performance. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve the SC-Flip decoding algorithm for low-rate codes, based on the observation of channel-induced error distributions. The first one is a fixed index selection (FIS) scheme to avoid the substantial implementation cost of LLR selection and sorting with no cost on error-correction performance. The second is an enhanced index selection (EIS) criterion to improve the error-correction performance of SC-Flip decoding. A reduction of 24.6\% in the implementation cost of logic elements is estimated with the FIS approach, while simulation results show that EIS leads to an improvement on error-correction performance improvement up to 0.34 dB at a target FER of 10-4.},

Successive-cancellation (SC)-flip decoding was shown to be capable of a competitive error-correction performance compared to that of list decoding with a small list size, at a fraction of the complexity, but suffers from a variable execution time and a higher worst-case latency. In this work, we show how to modify the state-of-the-art high-speed SC decoding algorithm to incorporate the SC-flip ideas. The algorithmic improvements are presented as well as average execution-time results tailored to a hardware implementation.

	abstract = {The wish to obtain higher data rates in wireless data communication requires the consistent exploitation of the available physical resources. Special interest will be donated to not yet exploited resource space, which is available by the application of several antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. This thesis focusses on the multilayer MIMO system, where the data is divided at the transmitter into several data streams and emitted simultaneously. Due to the superposition of the data at the receiver simple detection of the data is no longer possible and thus requires new adapted methods from signal processing. 

This thesis prioritizes the analysis of these concepts and the development of new approaches for efficient detection. Therefore, several receiver architectures for non-frequency selective and for frequency selective transmission channels are presented. The successive detection will prove to yield a good compromise between complexity and performance. With the developed approach on basis of a sorted QR decomposition the required complexity is clearly reduced with only a marginal difference to the optimal successive detection. This fact is shown with respect to Monte-Carlo simulations and a detailed analysis of complexity. 

A further promising approach is given by the combination of successive detection with lattice reduction, a well known tool from lattice theory. The developed enhancement with respect to the MMSE criterion realizes almost the performance of the optimal detection. In comparison to the schemes known from literature this results in an obvious improvement of the detection quality with simultaneously decreasing the complexity. 

Within frequency selective scenarios spatial and temporal superposition of the signals occurs and results in a two dimensional equalization problem. To solve this task, the impulse shortening of MIMO systems and the extension of the successive detection method to frequency selective channels are investigated. In order to apply the detection concepts presented for nonfrequency selective channels it is also possible to transform the system into a multiplicity of flat MIMO channels in terms of OFDM or frequency domain equalization. In this connection the generalization of the sorted QR decomposition for several parallel channels realizes again a remarkable reduction in complexity in comparison to the scheme from literature.},

	abstract = {The belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm not only is an alternative to the successive cancelation (SC) decoders of polar codes, but also provides soft outputs that are necessary for joint detection and decoding. The BP decoders with the flooding schedule achieve high throughput with excessive hardware cost especially when the block length is large. The soft-cancelation (SCAN) decoders for polar codes have reduced memory complexity compared to the BP decoders based on the flooding schedule. The simplified SC aided reduced complexity soft-cancelation (S-RCSC) decoders further reduce the computational and memory complexity of the SCAN decoders at the cost of negligible error performance degradation. Both the SCAN and S-RCSC decoders have limited throughput due to their serial decoding schedules. In this paper, we first propose an improved S-RCSC (IS-RCSC) decoding algorithm and then present a high throughput decoder architecture based on our IS-RCSC algorithm. Our IS-RCSC decoding algorithm performs the message passing on a binary tree representation of a polar code. Compared to the S-RCSC decoding algorithm, our IS-RCSC decoding algorithm accelerates the computing of the returned soft messages when certain types of nodes are activated. The corresponding hardware architecture of our IS-RCSC decoder is also proposed. In terms of area efficiency, the hardware implementation results demonstrate that our IS-RCSC decoders are 19\% to 43\% better than decoders in the literature.},

Researchers have focused on implementing the computationally expensive algorithm on both GPPs and GPUs. A major leap in performance was reported in the groundbreaking paper by Bertrand le Gal [2]. This paper builds on the work in [2] by considering the scaling of that implementation on modern many-core processors. We look at the performance of LDPC code specified in the DVB-S2 standard. The large block size of the DVB-S2 code makes the memory architecture of the processor just as important as the clock rate and instruction set. We present results for two generations of Intel Xeons, an Intel Phi (KNL), the recently released AMD EPYC. The key finding is that performance scaling is limited by the amount of available cache memory rather than the number of cores. We also find that heavily multi-threaded, but deterministic software architecture benefits from explicit allocation of threads to cores vs. allowing the operating system to manage threading. The maximum throughput of 1 Gbps was achieved on a mid-range AMD server - issuing a new era of all-software receivers for very high rate waveforms. We also present the performance of the algorithm ported to a low-power ARM processor and compare that to a low-end Intel Core.},

The DP has complexity O(q(N -M)2M), where q, N, and M are alphabet sizes of the DMC input, DMC output, and the quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality (QI), we apply two techniques to reduce the DP's complexity. One technique makes use of the SMAWK algorithm with complexity O(q(N - M)M), while the other technique is much easier to be implemented and has complexity O(q(N2 - M2)). Moreover, we give a sufficient condition on the channel transition probability, under which the two low-complexity techniques can be applied for designing quantizers that maximize the $\alpha$-mutual information, which is a generalized objective function for channel quantization. This condition works for the general q-ary input case, including the previous work for q = 2 as a subcase.},

By utilizing Intel advanced vector extended 512 (AVX-512) instruction set, the efficiency of parallelism are
maximized and therefore the capacity of x86 processors can be fully exploited. In addition, new features of AVX-512 are further exploited to optimize load and store operations as well as preprocessing to reduce the operation cost. Experiments results also show that Intel Xeon Gold 6154 processors can achieve 42 to 272Mbps throughput with a single core for ten layered decoding

One key parameter that influences the energy efficiency is peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). PAPR is particularly revelant for cheap mass market terminals. In the most recent cellular standard, Long Term Evolution, different waveforms are used in downlink and uplink transmission, to address the issue of non-linear distortions as a consequence of high PAPR. In this work, generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is explored as a possible, non-orthogonal waveform for next generation cellular systems. Particular focus lies on the PAPR properties of the generated waveform. First, various filtered multi-carrier techniques, including OFDM, SC-FDE and GFDM, are presented in an unified framework. Second, the PAPR of those schemes is compared in an uplink multiple access scenario. The results show that a non-orthogonal waveform brings additional degrees of freedom, which can be beneficial.},

In the case of a very strong interferer the conventional assumption of the interference as Gaussian is extremely suboptimal. However optimal (capacity achieving) receivers utilize some prior knowledge about the interference to reach optimality. The link abstraction for such receiver structures is not studied well. We investigate how the conventional mutual information based link abstraction technique can be extended for the accurate and efficient link performance modeling for low complexity optimal receivers. So, in this paper we propose a mutual information based link abstraction methodology of an optimal, low complexity interference aware receiver for multi-user MIMO in the frame work of LTE. For the sake of comparison we performed abstraction of interference aware receiver with Exponential Effective SINR Mapping (EESM) method as well. We show with the help of results that our proposed method outperforms the EESM and provides the system level with more accurate link quality metric.},

Due to the fact that GFDM uses only one cyclic prefix (CP) for a group of symbols rather than a CP per symbol and it has a well contained spectral properties, it is more bandwidth efficient than the widely used OFDM modulation. In this paper, we propose novel receiver designs for GFDM by taking advantage of the particular structure in the modulation matrix. A unified receiver structure for matched filter (MF), zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers is derived. Our proposed MF receiver is based on sparsification of the modulation matrix using block discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. The proposed ZF and MMSE receiver algorithms in this paper harness the special block circulant property of the matrices involved in the demodulation stage to reduce the computational cost of the system implementation. In addition, our algorithms do not incur any performance loss as no approximation is involved. The computational costs of our proposed techniques are analyzed in detail and are compared with the existing solutions that are known to have the lowest complexity. It should be highlighted that a substantial computational complexity reduction can be achieved by adopting our techniques.},

On the other hand, Cloud-RAN architecture introduces an additional link between the central, cloudified unit and the distributed radio unit, namely fronthaul (FH). Therefore, the foreseen reliability and latency for 5G services should also be provisioned over the FH link. In this paper, focusing on Ethernet as FH, we present a reliable packet-based FH communication and demonstrate the upper and lower bounds of latency that can be offered. These bounds yield insights into the trade-off between reliability and latency, and enable the architecture design through choice of splitting point, focusing on high layer split between PDCP and RLC and low layer split between MAC and PHY, under different FH bandwidth and traffic properties. Presented model is then analyzed both numerically and through simulation, with two classes of 5G services that are ultra reliable low latency (URLL) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).},

	abstract = {CRC (cyclic redundancy check) concatenated polar codes are superior to the turbo codes under the successive cancellation list (SCL) or successive cancellation stack (SCS) decoding algorithms. But the code length of polar codes is limited to the power of two. In this paper, a family of rate-compatible punctured polar (RCPP) codes is proposed to satisfy the construction with arbitrary code length. We propose a simple qusi-uniform puncturing algorithm to generate the puncturing table. And we prove that this method has better row-weight property than that of the random puncturing. Simulation results under the binary input additive white Gaussian noise channels (BI-AWGNs) show that these RCPP codes outperform the performance of turbo codes in WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) or LTE (Long Term Evolution) wireless communication systems in the large range of code lengths. Especially, the RCPP code with CRC-aided SCL/SCS algorithm can provide over 0.7dB performance gain at the block error rate (BLER) of 10-4 with short code length M = 512 and code rate R = 0.5. ? 2013 IEEE.},

Centralizing these functions reduces operating costs and enables coordination techniques. However, the more functions are centralized, the more capacity is needed on the fronthaul network connecting centralized and distributed units. In addition, the required fronthaul capacity also depends on the instantaneous user traffic, which varies over time. Therefore, in order to optimize its performance, the 5G RAN should be able to dynamically adapt its centralization level to the user traffic. In this paper, we present the design of an adaptive RAN that can switch between two different centralization options at runtime.

We consider a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) reception technique, where a number of base stations (BSs) send the received signals from user equipments (UEs) to a CoMP central unit (CCU) for joint detection and processing. We examine the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) on the performance of the proposed scheme and compare the results with the performance of cyclic prefix based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) systems. We use computer experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed multi-carrier scheme. The results indicate that the UFMC scheme outperforms the OFDM for both perfect and non-perfect frequency synchronization between the UEs and BSs.},

Recently, they have been selected as one of the coding schemes in the 5th generation wireless standard (5G). Over the years various polar code decoding algorithms, like SC-list (SCL), have been proposed to improve the mediocre performance of the successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm for finite code lengths; however, like SC, they suffer from long decoding latency. Fast decoding of polar codes tries to overcome this problem by identifying particular subcodes in the polar code and decoding them with efficient decoders. In this work, we introduce a generalized approach to fast decoding of polar codes to further reduce SC-based decoding latency. We propose three multi-node polar code subcodes whose identification patterns include most of the existing subcodes, extending them to SCL decoding, and allow to apply fast decoding to larger subsets of bits. Without any error-correction performance degradation, the proposed technique shows up to 23.6\% and 29.2\% decoding latency gain with respect to fast SC and SCL decoding algorithms, respectively, and up to 63.6\% and 49.8\% if a performance loss is accepted, whose amount depends on code and decoding algorithm parameters, along with the desired speedup.},

By spreading symbols in time (or frequency), we can completely eliminate the imaginary interference, so that all MIMO techniques known in OFDM can be straightforwardly applied in FBMC. The spreading process itself has negligible complexity because it is based on Hadamard matrices. Although spreading allows to restore complex orthogonality in FBMC within one transmission block, we observe interference from neighboring blocks. By including a guard time-slot, the signal-to-interference ratio can be improved. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of a time-variant channel on our spreading approach. Finally, testbed measurements show the applicability of our FBMC based MIMO transmission scheme in real world environments.},

From these polynomial equations, we can extract an interval for $\beta$, such that ranking the synthetic channels through a closed- form $\beta$-expansion preserves the property of nested frozen sets, which is a desired feature for low- complex construction. In an example of AWGN channels, we show that this interval for $\beta$ converges to a constant close to 1.1892 when the code block-length trends to infinity.

We also show that the proposed metric allows closely approaching the performance of an ideal SCFlip decoder. Second, we introduce a generalisation of the SCFlip decoder to a number of \${\textbackslash}backslashomega\$ nested flips, denoted by SCFlip-\${\textbackslash}backslashomega\$, using a similar optimized metric to determine the positions of the nested flips. We show that the SCFlip-2 decoder yields significant gains in terms of decoding performance and competes with the performance of the CRC-aided SC-List decoder with list size L=4, while having an average decoding complexity similar to that of the standard SC decoding, at medium to high signal to noise ratio.},

Results demonstrate that over quasi-static fading channels characterized by significant antenna diversity, mappings traditionally optimized for iterative receivers (e.g., Boronka mapping) outperform mappings more appropriate for non-iterative receivers (e.g., Gray mapping). In contrast, over quasi-static fading channels characterized by limited antenna diversity, Gray mapping always outperform Boronka mapping for all Eb/N0 and all iterations. Strikingly, this situation is in sharp contrast to that in the AWGN case. We note that we can further improve the performance of non-iterative systems (e.g., Gray mapping) having limited antenna diversity by increasing the memory size and removing the interleaving. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

The statistical information of the distortion reveals that the mapping scheme, which determines how symbols are inserted in the frequency-time grid, can be optimized to reduce the impact of the estimation error. Moreover, the distortion analysis has been exploited to design variable incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) schemes. Numerical results show that the algorithm devised in this work guarantees the target block error rate (BLER) in low mobility scenarios. In addition, the proposed variable IR-HARQ scheme allows to relinquish up to 75 \% of the resources to other users when the initial transmission fails.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a short packet GFDM-based physical (PHY) layer for industrial wireless networks to reduce latency. In our proposed PHY layer, the conventional OFDM scheme used in the data field of IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards is replaced by GFDM. The preamble size is also reduced from 10 symbols to 1 symbol. Furthermore, the fields of the overall packet structure are optimized in terms of total number of subcarriers and cyclic prefix length. Additionally, a noise-free GFDM scheme is subjected to concatenated channel coding to minimize error rate. Through simulation, packet transmission time is reduced by about 40 \~{} 72\% compared to the OFDM-based PHY layer while achieving a PER of order 10-3. The obtained results show that the GFDM-based PHY layer outperforms its counterpart by exhibiting a lower latency and high reliability. This performance renders the GFDM-based (proposed) PHY layer suitable for adoption in the development of wireless networks for latency and reliability constrained industrial applications. It should be noted that the simulations presented in this paper express our first step in the direction of using GFDM for industrial wireless networks to achieve low latency and high reliability. We therefore consider building a fully functional GFDM based-testbed as part of our future work.},

	abstract = {Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) as a sub-carrier filtered scheme can flexibly handle various different application scenarios of the fifth-generation system. However, due to the intrinsic self-interference resulting from the filter, the channel estimation becomes very hard, particularly when GFDM works with a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. In this paper, a new GFDM-dual filter (GFDM-DF) transmission scheme is proposed, which can guarantee the orthogonality of sub-carriers, so that the intrinsic self-interference can be eliminated. We first divide information symbols into odd-numbered and even-numbered sub-carrier symbols. Then, the orthogonality conditions for GFDM-DF are derived. According to the orthogonality conditions, we choose two different filters for odd-numbered and even-numbered sub-carriers. The signal-to-interference ratio of either the conventional GFDM or GFDM-DF is also evaluated. Moreover, based on the characteristics of the receiving matrix, we further design a low-complexity GFDM-DF receiver. Numerical results show that GFDM-DF can work well with the channel estimation and the MIMO system and its performance is better than that of the conventional GFDM system.},

	abstract = {The tactile internet (TI) is believed to be the prospective advancement of the internet of things (IoT), comprising human-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. TI focuses on enabling real-time interactive techniques with a portfolio of engineering, social, and commercial use cases. For this purpose, the prospective 5th generation (5G) technology focuses on achieving ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) services. TI applications require an extraordinary degree of reliability and latency. The 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) defines that URLLC is expected to provide 99.99\% reliability of a single transmission of 32 bytes packet with a latency of less than one millisecond. 3GPP proposes to include an adjustable orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, called 5G new radio (5G NR), as a new radio access technology (RAT). Whereas, with the emergence of a novel physical layer RAT, the need for the design for prospective next-generation technologies arises, especially with the focus of network intelligence. In such situations, machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to be essential to assist in designing intelligent network resource allocation protocols for 5G NR URLLC requirements. Therefore, in this survey, we present a possibility to use the federated reinforcement learning (FRL) technique, which is one of the ML techniques, for 5G NR URLLC requirements and summarizes the corresponding achievements for URLLC. We provide a comprehensive discussion of MAC layer channel access mechanisms that enable URLLC in 5G NR for TI. Besides, we identify seven very critical future use cases of FRL as potential enablers for URLLC in 5G NR.},

The detailed measurements and data processing methods are given using the present GSM-Railways (GSM-R) network, which can be used as the guide method to conduct the narrowband measurements in high-speed railway viaduct scenarios. Based on the log-normal shadowing path loss model, the investigation is made on the effect of reference distance on path loss exponent and standard deviation, which are not well-covered by existing models. The values of path loss exponents and standard deviations calculated with different reference distances are compared. A novel model is proposed to describe the relation of them. It applies to high-speed railway viaduct scenarios, with base antenna heights higher or lower than 25 meters. It raises path loss prediction accuracy and gives the suggestion on large scale modeling considering the effect of reference distance.},

In this paper we go over the weaknesses and limitations of GNU Radio version 3, and how they are being addressed as part of 4.0. Using preliminary results showing various forms of processing gain, we demonstrate why re-architecting GNU Radio is necessary to provide a software defined radio framework suitable for the complex workflows of future applications.

NTN components have been officially included in the 5G ecosystem by 3GPP in the latest Release-17. 5G-NTN research is ongoing and it is desirable to have a platform that facilitates quick prototyping of the proof-of-concept methods. OpenAirInterface(OAI) is an open-source experimental yet 3GPP standard-compliant Software Defined Radio (SDR) based protocol stack that has been widely known for implementing 4G/5G technologies. Due to its proven capabilities and flexibility, OAI is currently in the developmental process of integrating adaptations for the 5G-NTN. In this work, we discuss the peculiar features of OAI which are shaping it towards becoming a preferred tool for research and experimentation related to 5G-NTN. We provide details of completed/ongoing 5G-NTN projects leveraging OAI to achieve their objectives. In particular, we discuss 5G-GOA and 5G-LEO where critical adaptations in OAI are being done to support 5G-NTN use-cases. Such adaptations enable direct-access between UE and gNB via transparent payload Geostationary (5G-GOA) and Non-geostationary satellites (5G-LEO). Both projects have closely followed 3GPP discussions over 5G-NTN and the adaptations are compliant with the currently frozen 3GPP Release-17. OAI adaptations from both projects will be merged into the main development branch of OAI. We also provide a future roadmap of OAI towards 5G-NTN development. We believe that the pioneering steps taken in the course of the aforementioned projects will establish OAI as a preferred tool for 5G-NTN research and experimentations.},

Onboard processing for advanced AI/ML algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms, requires an improvement of several magnitudes in computing power compared to what is available with legacy, radiation-tolerant, space-grade processors in space vehicles today.

Indeed, multi-core architectures provide both high-processing performance and flexibility, such that they are used in current base station systems instead of dedicated FPGA or ASIC devices. Currently, an extension of the SDR concept is running. Indeed, cloud platforms become attractive for the virtualization of radio access network functions. Actually, they improve the efficiency of the computational resource usage, and thus the global power efficiency. However, the implementation of a physical layer on a Cloud-RAN platform as discussed by Wubben and Paul (2016); Checko et al. (JAMA 17(1):405{\textendash}426, 2015); Inc (2015); and Wubben et al.

(2016) is a challenging task according to the drastic latency and throughput constraints as discussed by Yu et al. (2017) and Parvez (2018). Processing latencies from 10 $\mu$s up to hundred of $\mu$s are required for future digital communication systems. In this context, most of works about software implementations of ECC applications is based on massive frame parallelism to reach high throughput. Nonetheless, they produce unacceptable decoding latencies. In this paper, a new turbo decoder parallelization approach is proposed for x86 multi-core processors. It provides both: high-throughput and lowlatency performances. In comparison with all CPU- and GPU-related works, the following results are observed: shorter processing latency, higher throughput, and lower energy consumption. Regarding to the best state-of-the-art x86 software implementations, 1.5{\texttimes} to 2{\texttimes} throughput improvements are reached, whereas a latency reduction of 50{\texttimes} and an energy reduction of 2{\texttimes} are observed.},

	abstract = {Polar codes form a very powerful family of codes with a low complexity decoding algorithm that attains many information theoretic limits in error correction and source coding. These codes are closely related to Reed-Muller codes because both can be described with the same algebraic formalism, namely they are generated by evaluations of monomials. However, finding the right set of generating monomials for a polar code which optimises the decoding performances is a nontrivial task and is channel dependent. The purpose of this paper is to reveal some universal properties of these monomials. We will namely prove that there is a way to define a nontrivial (partial) order on monomials so that the monomials generating a polar code devised for a binary-input symmetric channel always form a decreasing set. We call such codes decreasing monomial codes. The fact that polar codes are decreasing monomial codes turns out to have rather deep consequences on their structure. Indeed, we show that decreasing monomial codes have a very large permutation group by proving that it contains a group called lower triangular affine group. Furthermore, the codewords of minimum weight correspond exactly to the orbits of the minimum weight codewords that are obtained from evaluations of monomials of the generating set. In particular, it gives an efficient way of counting the number of minimum weight codewords of a decreasing monomial code and henceforth of a polar code.},

Successive-cancellation (SC) decoding and thus SC-based AE decoding are invariant with respect to the only known polar code automorphisms, namely those of the lower-triangular affine (LTA) group. To overcome this problem, we provide methods to determine whether a given polar code has non-LTA automorphisms and to identify such automorphisms. Building on this, we design specific polar codes that admit automorphisms in the upper-diagonal linear (UTL) group, and thus render SC-based AE decoding effective. Demonstrated by examples, these new polar codes under AE decoding outperform conventional polar codes under SC list decoding in terms of error rate, while keeping the latency comparable to SC decoding. Moreover, state-of-the-art BP-based permutation decoding for polar codes is beaten by BP-based AE thanks to this design.},

For polar codes, only a part of the automorphism group was known, namely the lower-triangular affine group (LTA), which is solely based upon the partial order of the code's synthetic channels. Depending on the design, however, polar codes can have a richer set of automorphisms. In this paper, we extend the LTA to a larger subgroup of the general affine group (GA), namely the block lower-triangular affine group (BLTA) and show that it is contained in the automorphism group of polar codes. Furthermore, we provide a low complexity algorithm for finding this group for a given information/frozen set and determining its size. Most importantly, we apply these findings in automorphism-based decoding of polar codes and report a comparable error-rate performance to that of successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding with significantly lower complexity.},

The coding schemes are evaluated in terms of block error rate (BLER), bit error rate (BER), computational complexity, and flexibility. These parameters comprise a suitable set to assess the performance of different services and applications. Turbo, low density parity check (LDPC), and polar codes are considered as the candidate schemes. These are investigated in terms of obtaining suitable rates, block lengths by proper design for a fair comparison. The simulations have been carried out in order to obtain BLER / BER performance for various code rates and block lengths, in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It can be seen from the simulations that although polar codes perform well at short block lengths, LDPC has a relatively good performance at all the block lengths and code rates. In addition, complexity of the LDPC codes is relatively low.},

	abstract = {The deployment of 5G and 6G is highly motivated by the emerging network services that demand more band-width and very low latency. Besides, these services are shifting from dominant Downlink (DL) Traffic to a more equilibrate DL/UpLink (UL) and dominant UL traffic for specific emerging services. One option to accommodate this new behavior is to use Time Duplex Division (TDD), where the radio frame is shared between UL and DL time slots, namely UL/DL pattern. While 4G TDD has a fixed number of configurations that cannot be updated on runtime, 5GNR allows complete flexibility to define the UL/DL pattern. Therefore, 5G base stations can dynamically change the pattern to adapt to the type of traffic (i.e., UL or DL). However, the 5G standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the UL/DL pattern. To fill this gap, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that adds intelligence to the base station to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell type. The proposed DRL algorithm monitors UL and DL buffers at the 5G base station to derive the optimal UL/DL pattern in respect to the current traffic configuration. The proposed solution delivers the optimal configuration in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to avoid buffer overflow and ensure the generality by reacting to traffic pattern changes.},

	abstract = {A 5G campus network is a 5G network for the users affiliated with the campus organization, e.g., an industrial campus, covering a prescribed geographical area. A 5G campus network can operate as a so-called 5G non-standalone (NSA) network (which requires 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) spectrum access) or as a 5G standalone (SA) network (without 4G LTE spectrum access). 5G campus networks are envisioned to enable new use cases, which require cyclic delay-sensitive industrial communication, such as robot control. We design a rigorous testbed for measuring the one-way packet delays between a 5G end device via a radio access network (RAN) to a packet core with sub-microsecond precision as well as for measuring the packet core delay with nanosecond precision. With our testbed design, we conduct detailed measurements of the one-way download (downstream, i.e., core to end device) as well as one-way upload (upstream, i.e., end device to core) packet delays and losses for both 5G SA and 5G NSA hardware and network operation. We also measure the corresponding 5G SA and 5G NSA packet core processing delays for download and upload. We find that typically 95\% of the SA download packet delays are in the range from 4-10 ms, indicating a fairly wide spread of the packet delays. Also, existing packet core implementations regularly incur packet processing latencies up to 0.4 ms, with outliers above one millisecond. Our measurement results inform the further development and refinement of 5G SA and 5G NSA campus networks for industrial use cases. We make the measurement data traces publicly available as the IEEE DataPort 5G Campus Networks: Measurement Traces dataset (DOI 10.21227/xe3c-e968).},

	abstract = {5G campus networks, whose advantages include flexible deployment, can be a promising candidate for production plants to complement existing Wifi-based networks. Toward that goal, 5G has to satisfy strict requirements about real-time communication to facilitate novel use cases. However, the realtime-capability of 5G is not well understood yet. In this work, we deliver insights into the functioning of 5G NR RAN Release 15, which includes actual one-way delay and Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurements for Downlink and Uplink in a private 5G Standalone campus network. The extensive measurement results reveal that these delays are correlated, and the corresponding RTT, i.e. the sum of Downlink and Uplink delays, is discreetly clustered, ranging between 12ms and 40ms. The measurements also show that the distribution of RTTs is mainly dependent on the packet rates and their inter-arrival times. Our study helps expand the current understanding of 5G used for latency-critical applications. We make the code and the measurement data traces publicly available as the IEEE DataPort 5G Campus Networks: Measurement Traces dataset (DOI 10.21227/xe3c-e968).},

	abstract = {Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) alliance was recently launched to devise a new RAN architecture featuring open, software-driven, virtual, and intelligent radio access architecture. O-RAN architecture is based on (1) disaggregated RAN functions that run as Virtual Network Function (VNF) and Physical Network Function (PNF); (2) the notion of RAN controller that runs centrally RAN applications such as mobility management, users{\textquoteright} scheduling, radio resources allocation, etc. The RAN controller is in charge of enforcing the application decisions by using open interfaces with the RAN functions. One important feature introduced by O-RAN is the heavy usage of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly Deep Learning (DL), to foster innovation and ease the deployment of intelligent RAN applications that are able to fulfill the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the envisioned 5G and beyond network services. In this work, we first give an overview of the evolution of RAN architectures toward 5G and beyond, namely C-RAN, vRAN, and O-RAN. We also compare them based on various perspectives, such as edge support, virtualization, control and management, energy consumption, and AI support. Then, we review existing DL-based solutions addressing the RAN part. We also show how they can be integrated/mapped to the O-RAN architecture since these works were not initially adapted to the O-RAN architecture. In addition, we present two case studies for DL techniques deployment in O-RAN. Furthermore, we describe how the main steps of deployed DL models in O-RAN can be automated, to ensure stable performance of these models, introducing ML system operations (MLOps) concept in O-RAN. Finally, we identify key technical challenges, open issues, and future research directions related to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled O-RAN architecture.},
